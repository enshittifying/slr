## KEY RULES AND BEST PRACTICES

### General Rules

1. **In Case Names**: Use abbreviations from Table T6 only for widely recognized acronyms or as specifically listed in Table T6.

2. **In Court Designations**: Use abbreviations from Table T7. For federal circuits, use abbreviated form (e.g., 5th Cir., not Fifth Circuit).

3. **In Textual Sentences**: Generally spell out full names and titles in running text, not citations. Use abbreviations only in citations unless the abbreviation is universally recognized.

4. **Geographic Terms**: Use abbreviations from Table T10 for geographic locations in citations. Spell out in textual sentences (adjectives from geographic abbreviations are not abbreviated).

5. **Months**: Use Table T12 abbreviations in citations (Jan., Feb., etc.). May and June are typically not abbreviated.

6. **Reporter Abbreviations**: Always use proper reporter abbreviations from Table T1. Format includes reporter series designation (e.g., F.3d for third series Federal Reporter).

7. **Statutory Abbreviations**: Use proper state code abbreviations from Table T1. Do not invent abbreviations for statutes not listed.

8. **Punctuation**: Most abbreviations are followed by a period. Exceptions include: ampersand (&), compass directions when used alone (N., S., E., W.), and some specialized abbreviations.

9. **Spacing in Abbreviations**: Generally, use periods and spaces as indicated. Some abbreviations run together (e.g., N.Y.S.2d, not N.Y.S. 2d).

10. **Possessives**: Apostrophes in abbreviations should be preserved when appropriate (e.g., Att'y, Sec'y).

### Special Considerations

- **Widely Recognized Acronyms**: Can be used even outside formal abbreviation tables (e.g., FBI, CIA in case names when standard usage applies)

- **Uniform Laws**: Always use "Unif." prefix (e.g., Unif. Probate Code, not Uniform Probate Code)

- **Foreign Law**: Use the country's standard abbreviations as given in Table T2. Do not translate abbreviations.

- **Session Laws**: Different states have different formats. Check Table T1 for specific state session law abbreviations.

- **Court Designations**: Include appropriate court designation in parentheses if not evident from the reporter (e.g., "Cal. Ct. App." or "5th Cir.").
