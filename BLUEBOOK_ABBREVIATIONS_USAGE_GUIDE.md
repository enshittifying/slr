# BLUEBOOK RULE 6: COMPREHENSIVE USAGE GUIDE

## Complete Rule 6 Application Guide

This guide explains how to properly apply Bluebook abbreviations in legal writing and citations.

---

## PART 1: FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES

### Rule 6.1(a): When to Abbreviate

Abbreviate according to the Bluebook tables **ONLY IN CITATIONS**. In textual sentences, spell out names in full.

#### Incorrect (abbreviations in text):
"The U.S. Att'y for the S.D.N.Y. filed charges against the Corp."

#### Correct (citations only):
"The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York filed charges against the corporation. See United States v. XYZ Corp., 456 U.S. 789 (2020)."

---

### Rule 6.1(b): Widely Recognized Acronyms

Some acronyms are so well-known they can be used in textual sentences without abbreviation:

Examples:
- FBI, CIA, IRS (no periods in these common initialisms)
- NAFTA, NATO
- FDIC, OSHA
- SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)

**NOTE:** Even these may need definition on first use depending on audience and context.

FULL:          Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review
```

### Rule 6.1(c): "Law" at Beginning of Case Name

If "Law" is the first word of a case name, **do not abbreviate it**.

#### Correct:

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Can I abbreviate "United States" as "U.S." in textual sentences?
