HOW TO USE THE MASTER JSON FILE
================================================================================

1. PROGRAMMATIC ACCESS:
   - Load the JSON file in any programming language (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
   - Parse rules by ID (e.g., data["rules"]["1"] for Rule 1)
   - Access specific fields (e.g., examples, regex patterns)
   - Validate citations using regex patterns
   - Build validation tools/linters

2. REFERENCE LOOKUP:
   - Find specific rule information quickly
   - Get formatting requirements for each rule
   - Review practical examples
   - Check regex patterns for automation

3. TOOL DEVELOPMENT:
   - Build citation validators using error_regex_patterns
   - Create citation formatters using correct_regex_patterns
   - Develop interactive Bluebook guides
   - Create linting tools for legal writing

4. TESTING:
   - Use examples for unit testing
   - Validate regex patterns
   - Test citation parsing

================================================================================
