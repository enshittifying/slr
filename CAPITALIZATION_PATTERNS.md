## Quick Reference: Capitalization Decision Tree

### Is it a TITLE or NAME?

#### YES - Title (Book, Article, Document, Court, Act, etc.)

1. **Specific official name?** → CAPITALIZE each word except articles/conjunctions/short prepositions
2. **Generic reference?** → lowercase unless it's a proper noun
3. **Court name?** → CAPITALIZE "Court" if U.S. Supreme Court; lowercase "court" otherwise
4. **Judge/official title before a name?** → CAPITALIZE (Chief Justice Marshall)
5. **Judge/official title generic?** → lowercase (any justice may...)

#### NO - Regular text

1. **Constitutional subdivision (Amendment, Article, Clause)?** → CAPITALIZE (even if generic in SLR)
2. **Act or statute name?** → CAPITALIZE if specific (Civil Rights Act); lowercase if generic (the act)
3. **Generic term** → lowercase (the court, the amendment, the document)
4. **Proper noun** → CAPITALIZE always

|---------|----------------|-----------------|----------|

**BUT ALWAYS CAPITALIZE:**

## Related Rules Reference

- **Rule 2**: Typeface conventions (determines Roman vs. italics for titles)

## Notes for Legal Writers

1. **Consistency is Key**: Once you establish that "the Court" refers to U.S. Supreme Court, use "the Court" throughout
2. **Context Matters**: Generic references like "the court decided" use lowercase, but specific court names are capitalized
3. **Typeface + Capitalization**: The typeface used (italics, roman, small caps) affects how readers interpret the element's importance
4. **SLR vs. Bluebook**: For SLR submissions, note the departures regarding first-page capitalization and ethnic/national groups
5. **Parentheticals**: Be careful with opening words in parentheticals - they should be lowercase unless proper nouns
