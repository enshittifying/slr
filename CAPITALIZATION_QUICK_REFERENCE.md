## When in Doubt: Three Questions

1. **Is this a specific official name?**
   - YES → CAPITALIZE each word (except articles/conjunctions/short prepositions)
   - NO → Continue to Question 2

2. **Is this a proper noun (like a name, place, institution)?**
   - YES → CAPITALIZE
   - NO → Continue to Question 3

3. **Is this a generic/common reference?**
   - YES → lowercase
   - NO → Capitalize as appropriate

## Typeface Indicators

The typeface tells you about capitalization:

**ITALICS in law review footnotes = **
- Case names, book titles, periodical titles
- Follow standard title case capitalization

**ROMAN TYPE (not italicized) = **
- Court documents, legislative materials
- Still follow title case capitalization for document names
- Examples: Brief for Petitioner, Motion in Limine

**SMALL CAPS = **
- Institutional author names, regulation titles
- Follow capitalization of source

---

## Institutional Author Names (Small Caps)

In law review footnotes, use SMALL CAPS for:
- U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
- AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION
- CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE

---

## Notes

- **Consistency**: Once you establish "the Court" = U.S. Supreme Court, use throughout
- **Context Matters**: Same word can be capitalized or lowercase depending on use
- **SLR Differences**: Check document guidelines for departures from standard Bluebook
- **Always Check Tables**: Reference T6 (abbreviations), T10 (geographic terms), T13 (periodicals)
