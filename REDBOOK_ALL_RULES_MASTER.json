Please phrase your comments as requests and provide suggestions \n        for improvement. Comments about the substantive correctness of a citation should go in the citecheck spreadsheet; the SE will turn \n        them into inline [AA:] comments if she decides it is necessary for the author to address the issue.\n\nSE (Senior Editor)\n\nUse [SE:] notations to alert your Senior Editor to minor problems that are better resolved by SLR staff rather than by the author and are more easily described inline than in the citecheck spreadsheet. Be sure to \n        (1) describe the nature of the problem; (2) suggest a solution; and, if it’s an editing concern, (3) direct the SE’s attention \n        to any portion of The Bluebook , The Redbook , or CMOS that may be relevant in resolving the issue. Do \n        not use [SE:] comments to raise substantive citechecking problems; those comments should be \n        left in the citecheck spreadsheet. If you think future editors would benefit from seeing the problem and its resolution, use the \n        citecheck spreadsheet. If the problem is serious or pervasive, please email your SE right away in addition to leaving an [SE:] comment or citecheck spreadsheet note.\n\nME (Managing Editor)\n\nUse [ME:] notations to alert the Managing Editors about technical changes that need to be made to \n        the formatting of the article (for example, headers, footnote numbering, pagination, or anything that requires manual intervention \n        in Word). Do not adjust the formatting of the piece on your own, and never add or delete a footnote.\n\nRCC (Re-Citecheck)\n\nUse [RCC] notations to flag sources that could not be fully citechecked.

        "16.1: Nonconsecutively Paginated Journals and Magazines",
        "A nonconsecutively paginated journal is a journal in which each issue starts on page one. A consecutively paginated journal has each volume start on page one, but each issue starts where the previous one left off.",
        "For every periodical, you must check whether it is consecutively paginated, and thus falls under BB 16.4, or nonconsecutively paginated, and thus falls under BB 16.5. To check, find the periodical on a library database or the periodical’s website, pull up all issues from the same year or volume as the cited source , and see whether each issue starts on page one. The pagination schemes of some journals do change over time, so it is important to check the year or volume in which the cited source appears.",
        "Once you confirm that a periodical is consecutively or nonconsecutively paginated, please note your findings in the Sourcepull spreadsheet so that future editors do not have to replicate the process."

When an author cites a source using a supra form, see BB 4.2(a), or refers to another footnote within the article (for example, \" see infra note 44 and accompanying text\"), the footnote number should be provided using an automatic cross-reference rather than plain text. If the document already contains a cross-reference, make sure it is updated and still points to the correct footnote (to update dynamic cross-references, see the keyboard shortcuts table at the end of this document).

To check, find the periodical on a library database or the periodical’s website, pull up all issues from the same year or volume as the cited source , and see whether each issue starts on page one.
