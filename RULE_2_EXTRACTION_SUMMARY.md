# Rule 2 Typeface Rules - Extraction Summary

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document summarizes the complete extraction of ALL typeface rules from the Bluebook Rule 2 and related sections, including the distinctions between Whitepages (academic writing) and Bluepages (practitioner/court documents).

---

## EXTRACTED RULE 2 SECTIONS

### Primary Rule 2: "Typefaces for Law Reviews" (Bluebook - White Pages)

**Rule 2 Introduction:**
Legal writing uses four typefaces, though choice of typeface conventions differs between academic writing and practitioner documents. In law review footnotes, specific typefaces (ordinary roman, italics, SMALL CAPS, and LARGE & SMALL CAPS) are used for different parts of a citation to convey meaning and to adhere to traditional styles.

**Four Typefaces Identified:**
1. Ordinary roman type
2. Italics
3. SMALL CAPS
4. LARGE & SMALL CAPS

---

### Rule 2.1: "Typeface Conventions for Citations" (Whitepages)

#### What Gets ITALICIZED
- Case names (including procedural phrases like "In re", "Ex parte")
- Book titles
- Titles of periodicals (including student-written works in periodicals)

#### What Gets ORDINARY ROMAN TYPE
- Titles of court documents (briefs, petitions) when referred to in text
- Titles of legislative materials
- Explanatory phrases
- Introductory signals (See, See also, Cf., But see, etc.)
- Prior or subsequent history explanatory phrases (aff'd, rev'd, cert. denied, etc.)

#### What Gets SMALL CAPS
- Institutional author names in citations
- Titles of regulations in a code

#### What Gets LARGE & SMALL CAPS
- Specific citation contexts (less common)

---

### Rule 2.2: "Typeface Conventions for Textual Material" (Whitepages)

**Available Typefaces:** Only two (roman and italics)

#### What Gets ITALICIZED in Main Text
1. Case names (including "v." and procedural phrases such as "In re")
2. Titles of publications, speeches, or articles
3. Words italicized for emphasis or style

#### What Gets ORDINARY ROMAN
- Everything else (the vast majority of text)

**Special Context - Footnote Text:**
- Citations are allowed and can be embedded within textual sentences
- Case names that are part of a textual sentence in a footnote are italicized

---

## EXTRACTED REDBOOK SECTIONS (Blue Pages - Practitioner Documents)

### Rule 2.1 (Redbook): "Underlined Type"

**Usage:** SLR uses underlining (or italics) only in a small handful of situations:
- Some textual case names
- Book titles
- In certain documents (see RB 16.5, 18.7)

**Restrictions:**
- Do not underline text for emphasis
- Do not underline punctuation adjacent to underlined text

---

### Rule 2.2 (Redbook): "Bolded Type"

**Usage:** SLR uses bold text only in Extraordinary Circumstances

**When Allowed:**
- A Stanford Law Review print piece may use bold in the rare case that the author's argument explicitly centers around an emphasized word (e.g., "fair" vs. "free" trade)
- Bold type is sometimes used for Article titles in citations; follow author's lead

**When Not Allowed:**
- Do not add bold for emphasis in standard circumstances
- Remove bold if authors add it inappropriately

---

### Rule 2.3 (Redbook): "Italics and Punctuation"

**Rule:** Italicize punctuation marks only if they are immediately adjacent to italicized words.

**Application:** If there is a space between an italicized word and a punctuation mark, do not italicize the punctuation mark.

---

## COMPREHENSIVE TYPEFACE RULES EXTRACTED

### Rule 2.1(d) - Punctuation with Italics (Bluebook)
Italicize punctuation marks only if they are immediately adjacent to italicized words. If there is a space between an italicized word and a punctuation mark, do not italicize the punctuation mark.

### Rule 1.2 - Signals as Verbs
When a signal is used as a verb in text (not in a citation), italicize it:
- "This analysis *sees* the issue as important."
- Does NOT apply when signal is in a citation sentence: "See Smith v. Jones..."

### Rule 3.5 - Internal Cross-References
Use "supra" or "infra" in italics:
- "Part II.A.1, *infra*"
- "*Supra* at 15"

### Rule 7 - Italicization for Style
Words may be italicized for emphasis or stylistic purposes (use sparingly).

#### Traditionally Italicized
- Words used as words
- Foreign words not commonly used in English
- Letters or numerals referenced as such
- Words being defined

#### NOT Typically Italicized
- Words in Black's Law Dictionary
- Words in Merriam-Webster
- Words incorporated into common English usage
- Longer foreign phrases

### Rule 10.6.3 - Case Citations in Parentheticals
When one case citation is quoted or cited within the parenthetical of another, format the interior citation in normal citation format but do NOT italicize it (because the parenthetical as a whole is not italicized in law review footnotes, and interior citations remain roman).

### Rule 15.8 - Periodical Names
Periodical names are abbreviated per Table T13 (law journals) or T10 (general terms). Use small caps for periodical names in law review footnotes.

### Rule 16.6.4 - Newspaper Series Names
If a citation is to a special report or series in a newspaper, include the series name in the citation (in italics, after the newspaper name).
