# Rule 2 Typeface Patterns - Practical Examples and Quick Reference

## PATTERN 1: ITALICS USAGE

### Where Italics Appear (White Pages - Academic)

#### In Text
```
Case names:        Roe v. Wade held...
Procedural:        In re Smith involved...
Titles:            The New York Times reported...
Emphasis:          This is *very* important.
```

#### In Footnote Citations
```
Case citation:     1. Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).
Book citation:     2. JOHN HART ELY, DEMOCRACY AND DISTRUST (1980).
Periodical:        3. John Smith, Title, 110 STAN. L. REV. 1 (2020).
```

### Where Italics DON'T Appear (White Pages)
```
Wrong:    1. See PERIODICAL NAME...  [Periodical should be SMALL CAPS]
Wrong:    1. See Smith v. Jones (in a parenthetical context where roman is required)
Wrong:    1. Brief for Appellant (should be roman when referring to court doc in text)
```

### Italics in Court Documents (Blue Pages)

```
Minimal use:    Only in specific contexts like RB 16.5, 18.7
Not for emphasis: Do not italicize for emphasis
Case names:     May underline instead of italicize
```

---

## PATTERN 2: SMALL CAPS USAGE

### Where SMALL CAPS Appear (White Pages Only)

#### Institutional Author Names in Citations
```
Example 1: AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION, Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2020).
Example 2: See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS § 5 (2010).
Example 3: FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE Rule 12(b).
```

#### Regulation Titles in Citations
```
Example 1: I.R.C. § 26 (referring to "Internal Revenue Code")
Example 2: TREAS. REG. § 1.165-7 (Treasury Regulation)
Example 3: 29 U.S.C. § 206 (United States Code as institution)
```

#### Periodical Names (Most Common Use)
```
Example 1: 110 STAN. L. REV. 1 (2020)
Example 2: 91 HARV. L. REV. 501 (1978)
Example 3: John Smith, Title, in 110 YALE L.J. 42, 45 (2020)
```

### SMALL CAPS NEVER Appear in Blue Pages

```
Wrong (Blue):  See AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION... [No SMALL CAPS in court docs]
Correct:       See American Bar Association...
```

---

## PATTERN 3: ROMAN TYPE (ORDINARY)

### What Gets Roman Type (White Pages - Citations)

#### Signals
```
See Smith v. Jones...
See also Brown v. Board of Education...
Cf. Doe v. Bolton...
But see Plessy v. Ferguson...
```

**EXCEPTION - Signals as Verbs in Text:**
```
This analysis *sees* the issue as complex.  [*sees* is italicized as a verb]
But when not a verb: "This sees no contradiction..." [not italicized]
```

#### Court Documents Referenced in Text
```
In the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment...
The Court's Order was clear...
The Brief for Respondent argued...
```

#### Legislative Material Titles
```
Internal Revenue Code § 26
Social Security Act
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
```

#### Explanatory Phrases in Parentheticals
```
(explaining the plain-view doctrine)
(noting the constitutional concern)
(defining "substantial evidence")
(rejecting the prior approach)
```

#### Prior/Subsequent History
```
aff'd, rev'd, cert. denied, vacated, remanded
sub nom., sub nom. on other grounds
```

---

## PATTERN 4: PUNCTUATION WITH ITALICS

### Rule: Italicize Punctuation Only If Immediately Adjacent

#### Correct Examples
```
Correct:  *Roe v. Wade* (case name and period together)
Correct:  *See* Smith v. Jones (signal italicized with comma immediately following)
Correct:  In *re* Smith (italic with preposition intact)
Correct:  *See* also (signal with following word)
```

#### Incorrect Examples
```
Wrong:    *Roe v. Wade.* (period outside should not be italicized if there's space)
Wrong:    *See,* Smith v. Jones (comma separately italicized - should be: *See*, Smith v. Jones)
Wrong:    *In* re Smith (punctuation/word not immediately attached)
```

#### Space Rule
```
Guideline: If there is a space between italicized word and punctuation mark,
           do not italicize the punctuation mark.

Example:   *See* Smith v. Jones. (See is italicized; period is not)
Example:   *Roe v. Wade*, 410 U.S. 113. (Case name italicized; punctuation normal)
```

---

## PATTERN 5: SIGNALS AND VERBS

### Signals in Citation Sentences (Roman)
```
1. See Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (2010).
2. See also Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954).
3. Cf. Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973).
4. But see Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).
```

### Signals as Verbs in Text (Italics)
```
This analysis *sees* the issue as important.
The precedent *cites* to earlier authority.
Courts *compare* these two approaches.
```

### Non-Verb Context (No Italics)
```
"This could see significant change." [sees is not a verb/signal here]
"Many cite this case." [cite is a regular verb, not a signal]
```

---

## PATTERN 6: SPECIAL CONTEXTS

### Foreign Words (Rule 7)
```
Italicized (not in English dictionaries):
- pro bono (sometimes)
- per curiam (for procedural contexts)
- amicus curiae
- mens rea

NOT Italicized (in common English use):
- habeas corpus
- prima facie
- in camera (when commonly used)

NOT Italicized (in standard dictionaries):
- Words in Black's Law Dictionary
- Words in Merriam-Webster
```

### Words Used as Words
```
The term "malice" is often misunderstood.
Or: The term *malice* is often misunderstood. [italicized when being defined]
```

### Defined Terms

```

### Case Names in Parentheticals (Roman - Exception)
```
(quoting Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (2010))

```

### Case Names with Procedural Phrases (All Italicized)

```
Case Names      | Italics (always)           | Underline/Italics (minimal)
Book Titles     | Italics                    | Underline/Italics
Periodicals     | SMALL CAPS                 | Not typically used
Signals         | Roman (italics if verb)    | Minimal use
Small Caps      | Extensive use              | Rarely/never used
Bold            | Not for emphasis           | Extremely rare
Underlining     | Not typical                | Minimal, for emphasis avoid

## PATTERN 10: COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: Italicizing Signals in Citations
```
Wrong:  1. *See* Smith v. Jones...
Right:  1. See Smith v. Jones...
Right:  This analysis *sees* the issue... (different context - verb in text)
```

### Mistake 2: Not Using SMALL CAPS for Periodicals
```
Wrong:  1. 110 Stanford Law Review 1 (2020).
Right:  1. 110 STAN. L. REV. 1 (2020).
```

### Mistake 3: Mixing Blue and White Pages Styles
```
Wrong:  Using SMALL CAPS for court document
Wrong:  Using minimal formatting in law review
```

### Mistake 4: Italicizing Punctuation When There's Space
```
Wrong:  *Roe v. Wade.* (period separately styled)
Right:  *Roe v. Wade*. (period not italicized)
```

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Signals Can Be Verbs
```
Wrong:  "This analysis sees the issue..." (should be italicized as verb signal)
Right:  "This analysis *sees* the issue..."
```

### Mistake 6: Over-Emphasizing with Italics
```
Wrong:  This is *extremely important* because *we must understand* that *courts have held*...
Right:  This is important because courts have held...
        [Use italics very sparingly, only when truly needed]
```

### Mistake 7: Using SMALL CAPS in Blue Pages
```
Wrong (Court doc):  See the AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION...
Right:             See the American Bar Association...
```

### Mistake 8: Underlining for Emphasis in Law Review
```
Wrong:  This is <u>very</u> important.
Right:  This is very important. [or sparingly: *very* important]
```
