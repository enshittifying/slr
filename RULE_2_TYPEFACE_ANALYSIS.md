# Bluebook Rule 2: Typeface Rules - Complete Analysis

## Overview
Rule 2 covers typeface conventions in legal writing. The Bluebook distinguishes between **White Pages** (academic writing in law reviews) and **Blue Pages** (practitioner documents and court filings). The specific typeface conventions differ significantly between these contexts.

## RULE 2 - TYPEFACES FOR LAW REVIEWS (White Pages - Academic)

### Introduction (Rule 2)
Legal writing uses **four typefaces**, though choice of typeface conventions differs between academic writing and practitioner documents. In law review footnotes, specific typefaces (ordinary roman, italics, SMALL CAPS, and LARGE & SMALL CAPS) are used for different parts of a citation to convey meaning and to adhere to traditional styles.

### Rule 2.1: Typeface Conventions for Citations

**Context:** Law review footnotes in academic writing

#### ITALICS
- Case names (including procedural phrases like "In re", "Ex parte")
- Book titles
- Titles of periodicals (including student-written works in periodicals)

#### ORDINARY ROMAN TYPE
- Titles of court documents (such as briefs and petitions) when referred to in text
- Titles of legislative materials
- Explanatory phrases (like parenthetical explanations)
- Introductory signals (See, See also, Cf., But see, etc.) - **NOTE:** Signals used as verbs in textual sentences are NOT italicized
- Prior or subsequent history explanatory phrases (aff'd, rev'd, cert. denied, etc.)

#### SMALL CAPS
- Institutional author names in citations
- Titles of regulations in a code

#### LARGE & SMALL CAPS
- Used in specific citation contexts (less common)

---

### Rule 2.2: Typeface Conventions for Textual Material (White Pages)

**Context:** Main text of law review pieces (does not contain citations)

#### TYPEFACES USED
Law review pieces use only **ordinary roman type** and **italics**.

#### WHAT IS ITALICIZED IN TEXT
1. Case names (including "v." and procedural phrases such as "In re")
2. Titles of publications, speeches, or articles
3. Words italicized for emphasis or style

#### WHAT IS ORDINARY ROMAN
- All other material (the vast majority)

#### SPECIAL NOTE - FOOTNOTE TEXT
In footnote text, citations are allowed and can be embedded within textual sentences (rule 1.1(b)). Case names that are part of a textual sentence in a footnote are italicized.

## RULE 2 - TYPEFACE CONVENTIONS (Blue Pages - Practitioner/Court Documents)

### Rule 2.1: Underlined Type (Redbook Section, RB 2.1)

**Context:** Court filings, briefs, and other practitioner documents

#### UNDERLINING OR ITALICS (Minimal Use)
SLR uses underlining (or italics) only in a **small handful of situations**:
- Some textual case names
- Book titles
- In certain documents (see RB 16.5, 18.7)

#### RESTRICTIONS
- Do not underline text for **emphasis**
- Do not underline punctuation adjacent to underlined text

---

### Rule 2.2: Bolded Type (Redbook Section, RB 2.2)

#### BOLD TEXT (Extremely Rare)
SLR uses bold text only in **Extraordinary Circumstances**.

#### WHEN BOLD MAY BE USED
- A Stanford Law Review print piece may use bold in the rare case that the author's argument explicitly centers around an emphasized word (e.g., a piece about "fair" vs. "free" trade)
- Bold type is sometimes used for Article titles in citations; follow the author's lead on whether to apply that rule

#### RESTRICTIONS
- Do not add bold for emphasis in any other circumstances
- Remove bold if authors add it in other contexts

---

### Rule 2.3: Italics and Punctuation (Redbook Section, RB 2.3)

#### PUNCTUATION ITALICIZATION RULE
Italicize punctuation marks **ONLY** if they are immediately adjacent to italicized words.

#### WHEN NOT TO ITALICIZE PUNCTUATION
If there is a space between an italicized word and a punctuation mark, do not italicize the punctuation mark.

#### Examples
- Correct: *See* (with italicized punctuation if immediately adjacent)
- Correct: "The case is settled." *See* Smith v. Jones (punctuation before the italicized signal is NOT italicized)

## NOTES

1. **White Pages vs Blue Pages:** The distinction is critical. White Pages (pages 1-160) cover law review writing; Blue Pages (pages 161 onwards) cover practitioner/court documents.

2. **SMALL CAPS Challenge:** True small caps are formatting, not content. Ensure proper formatting is applied.

3. **Consistency:** Within a single document, maintain consistent typeface conventions. Don't mix blue pages and white pages styles.

4. **Context Matters:** The same element (e.g., a book title) may be formatted differently depending on whether it appears in a citation footnote or in the main text.

5. **Emphasis Restraint:** Legal writing emphasizes content over formatting. Use typeface variations to convey meaning, not to make text pretty.
