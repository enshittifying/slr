# Bluebook Rule 1: Signals - Complete Extraction

## Rule 1: Structure and Use of Citations

Provide citations to authorities so that readers may identify and find those authorities for future research. Citations are made in citation sentences and clauses (rule 1.1) and are introduced by signals. Signals organize authorities and show how those authorities support or relate to a proposition given in the text (rule 1.2).

---

## Rule 1.2: Introductory Signals

### SUPPORTIVE SIGNALS
Signals that indicate support include: **E.g., Accord, See, See also, Cf. (with explanation)**

Use these signals when the cited authority clearly supports or directly states the proposition.

### COMPARATIVE SIGNALS
Signals suggesting a useful comparison include: **Compare... with..., See (other authority)**

Use these signals when the comparison between the authorities cited will offer support for or analogies to the proposition.

### CONTRADICTORY SIGNALS
Signals indicating contradiction include: **But see, But cf. (with explanation)**

Use these signals when the cited authority directly states or clearly supports a proposition contrary to the main proposition.

### BACKGROUND SIGNALS
Signals indicating background material include: **See generally**

Use these signals when the authority provides helpful background information or context for the proposition.

### SIGNALS AS VERBS
In footnotes, signals may be used as the verbs of textual sentences, but they should not be italicized when used in this way.

---

## Complete List of All Signals

### Primary/Direct Support
1. **E.g.** - exemplifies a rule or principle
2. **Accord** - indicates agreement with cited proposition
3. **See** - indicates direct support
4. **See also** - indicates additional support
5. **Cf.** - indicates useful comparison with some explanation

### Comparative/Analogous
6. **Compare** - introduces first element of comparison
7. **Compare... with** - shows comparison between authorities

### Contradictory/Opposing
8. **But see** - indicates contradiction
9. **But cf.** - indicates contradiction with useful comparison

### Background/General Reference
10. **See generally** - provides background material and context

---

## Rule 1.3: Order of Signals

When more than one signal is used, signals should appear in the order listed in Rule 1.2:
1. Supportive signals (E.g., Accord, See, See also, Cf.)
2. Comparative signals (Compare... with...)
3. Contradictory signals (But see, But cf.)
4. Background signals (See generally)

Signals of the same basic type must be strung together within a single citation sentence and separated by semicolons.

Signals of different types must be grouped in different citation sentences.

Example:
```
See Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307 (1976) (per curiam); cf. Palmer v. Ticcione,
433 F. Supp. 653 (E.D.N.Y. 1977) (upholding a mandatory retirement age for kindergarten teachers).
But see, e.g., Gault v. Garrison, 569 F.2d 993 (7th Cir. 1977) (holding that a classification of
public school teachers based on age violated equal protection absent a showing of justifiable and
rational state purpose). See generally Comment, O'Neil v. Baine: Application of Middle-Level Scrutiny
to Old-Age Classifications, 127 U. PA. L. REV. 798 (1979) (advocating a new constitutional approach
to old-age classifications).
```

---

## Rule 1.4: Order of Authorities Within Each Signal

Authorities within each signal are separated by **semicolons**.

Authorities should be ordered in a logical manner:
- If one authority or several authorities are considerably more helpful or authoritative than the others, list those first
- Then list remaining authorities in a separate sentence introduced by a signal such as "See also"
- Otherwise, list authorities of the same type (cases, statutes, etc.) in order of descending weight or importance

---

## Rule 1.5: Parenthetical Information

### Explanatory Parentheticals
- Include parenthetical information to explain the relevance of a cited authority
- Append as a present participial phrase, quoted sentence, or short statement
- Start with lowercase letter (unless first word is a proper noun)
- Should not start with a quotation mark

Example:
```
But see Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 264 (1984) (explaining that the final judgment
rule reduces the potential for delay and harassment in the federal appellate process).
```

---

## Rule 1.6: Related Authority

Certain additional information (subsequent history, related authority) should not be given parenthetically but through explanatory phrases.

---

## Typeface Rules for Signals (Rule 2.1)

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULE:**

Introductory signals are in **ordinary roman type (NOT italicized)** in law review footnotes.

```
CORRECT:  See Case Name, 123 U.S. 456 (2020).
INCORRECT: *See* Case Name, 123 U.S. 456 (2020).
```

However, when a signal is used as a VERB in textual material, it SHOULD be italicized:

```
CORRECT:   "This analysis *sees* the problem differently."
INCORRECT: "This analysis sees the problem differently."

Note: This rule applies only when the word functions as a verb.
If the word is used in another context (e.g., "this trend could see some effects"),
do not italicize it.
```

---

## SLR/Redbook Deviations and Clarifications

### Rule 1.5 (SLR): Multiple Sources Following Compare and Contrast
When using compare and contrast signals, separate multiple sources with **semicolons** (not commas).

```
CORRECT:   Compare Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), with Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973);
           compare Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 (1954), with Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).

Note: Multiple sources following other signals are separated by commas (e.g., See X, Y, and Z).
This rule applies only when using compare/contrast signals.
```

### Rule 1.6 (SLR): Multiple Sources Following a Signal as a Verb
When a signal is used as a verb, separate multiple sources with **semicolons**.

```
CORRECT:   But see Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973); Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973).

Multiple sources following other signals as verbs are separated by commas:
See also X, Y, and Z.
```

### Rule 1.12 (SLR): See Generally/Cf. Signals
Do not include explanatory parentheticals for sources following:
- **See generally**
- **Cf.** (comparative)

These signals indicate an extremely general or clearly analogous proposition. A parenthetical explanation would defeat that purpose.

---

## Punctuation Rules for Signals

### Citation Sentence Structure
1. Signal (roman type, not italicized) + space + citation
2. Multiple sources within same signal: separated by **semicolons**
3. Multiple citations with different signals: separated by **periods** (new citation sentence)
4. Signal followed by page number: no comma before page number

### Examples

**Single source:**
```
See Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (2020).
```

**Multiple sources, same signal:**
```
See Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (2020); Johnson v. Brown, 456 U.S. 789 (2021).
```

**Multiple signals, same type (supportive):**
```
E.g., Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (2020); accord Brown v. Green, 234 U.S. 567 (2019).
```

**Multiple signals, different types:**
```
See Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (2020). But see Johnson v. Brown, 456 U.S. 789 (2021).
```

**Signal with cf. (no parenthetical):**
```
Cf. Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (2020).
(NOT: Cf. Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (2020) (explaining...). )
```

**Signal with see generally (no parenthetical):**
```
See generally Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (2020).
(NOT: See generally Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (2020) (discussing...). )
```

## Regular Expressions for Signal Validation and Formatting

### Regex 1: Match Introductory Signals (Case-Insensitive)

```regex
^\s*(e\.g\.|accord|see|see\s+also|cf\.|compare|but\s+see|but\s+cf\.|see\s+generally)\b
```

**Explanation:**
- `^\s*` - Start of line with optional whitespace
- `(e\.g\.|accord|see|see\s+also|cf\.|compare|but\s+see|but\s+cf\.|see\s+generally)` - Exact signal match
- `\b` - Word boundary to prevent partial matches

**Test Cases:**
```
✓ See Smith v. Jones
✓ E.g., Johnson v. Brown
✓ Accord Brown v. Green
✓ See also Davis v. Miller
✓ Cf. Smith v. Davis
✓ Compare X with Y
✓ But see Brown v. Davis
✓ But cf. Smith v. Johnson
✓ See generally Smith v. Jones
✗ Seeing Smith (not a signal)
✗ Seen Smith (not a signal)
```

### Regex 2: Match Citation Sentence with Signal

```regex
^(e\.g\.|accord|see|see\s+also|cf\.|compare|but\s+see|but\s+cf\.|see\s+generally)\s+(.+?),\s+\d+\s+[A-Z\.\s]+\s+\d+\s*\(\d{4}\)\.?$
```

**Explanation:**
- Matches signal + case name + reporter + page + year + period
- Ensures proper spacing and punctuation

**Test Cases:**
```
✓ See Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (2020).
✓ E.g., Johnson v. Brown, 234 U.S. 567 (2019).
✓ Accord Davis v. Miller, 345 U.S. 678 (2018).
✗ see smith v. jones (missing punctuation, incorrect capitalization)
```

### Regex 3: Detect Incorrect Italicization of Signals

```regex
[*_]+(e\.g\.|accord|see|see\s+also|cf\.|compare|but\s+see|but\s+cf\.|see\s+generally)[*_]+\s+
```

**Explanation:**
- Matches italicized signal followed by space
- Uses `[*_]+` to match markdown or underline formatting

**Use Case:** Flag for removal of italics

### Regex 4: Multiple Sources Within Same Signal

```regex
(e\.g\.|accord|see|see\s+also|cf\.|compare|but\s+see|but\s+cf\.|see\s+generally)\s+(.+?),\s+\d+\s+[A-Z\.\s]+\s+\d+\s*\(\d{4}\);+\s+(.+?),\s+\d+\s+[A-Z\.\s]+\s+\d+\s*\(\d{4}\)\.
```

**Explanation:**
- Matches signal + first citation + semicolon + second citation
- Validates semicolon separation

### Regex 5: Validate No Parenthetical After See Generally or Cf.

```regex
(see\s+generally|cf\.)\s+(.+?),\s+\d+\s+[A-Z\.\s]+\s+\d+\s*\(\d{4}\)\s+\(
```

**Explanation:**
- Matches see generally or cf. followed by citation and opening parenthesis
- Flags for parenthetical removal

**Use Case:** Detect violations of Rule 1.12 (SLR)

### Regex 6: Validate Signal Capitalization

```regex
^(E\.g\.|Accord|See|See\s+also|Cf\.|Compare|But\s+see|But\s+cf\.|See\s+generally)\b
```

**Explanation:**
- Ensures signals are properly capitalized at sentence start
- First word capitalized, subsequent words lowercase

### Regex 7: Detect Signal Used as Verb (for italicization check)

```regex
\b(sees?|accord|cf\.?|compare)\b\s+(?!([A-Z]|\d+\s+[A-Z]))\w+
```

**Explanation:**
- Matches signal in middle of sentence not followed by citation
- Useful for identifying when italicization is needed

**Example Matches:**
```
✓ "This analysis sees the problem differently" (italicize "sees")
✓ "as we accord respect to" (italicize "accord")
✗ "See Smith v. Jones" (don't italicize - it's a signal)
```

### Regex 8: Match Compare...With Signal Structure

```regex
\bcompare\s+(.+?),\s+with\s+(.+?)[\.,;]
```

**Explanation:**
- Validates proper Compare...with structure
- Captures both sides of comparison

| Parenthetical explanation | Open paren before, close paren after, period after paren | Space before opening paren | `See X, 123 U.S. 456 (2020) (explaining Z).` |
| Parenthetical with See generally | NOT ALLOWED - omit parenthetical | N/A | `See generally X, 123 U.S. 456 (2020).` |
| Parenthetical with Cf. | NOT ALLOWED - omit parenthetical | N/A | `Cf. X, 123 U.S. 456 (2020).` |
