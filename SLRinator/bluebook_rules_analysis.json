Unless otherwise noted, the examples in\nThe Bluebook\ncorrespond to the convention for law review footnotes.\nFor an explanation of the typeface conventions commonly used in other forms of legal writing, see\nBluepages B2\n. Practitioners can make ready use of the examples in\nThe Bluebook\nby substituting the typeface conventions outlined in the\nBluepages\nfor those found in the examples throughout the rest of the book.\nFor example, a practitioner\u2019s brief might look like this:\nDirectors manage the business and affairs of a corporation.\nSee\nRevlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc.\n, 506 A.2d 173, 179 (Del. 1986);\nsee also\nDel. Code Ann. tit. 8, \u00a7 141(a) (2000). In\nGuth v.
