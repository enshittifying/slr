Citation Sentences and Clauses in Law Reviews
(pp. 65–66)
Citations may be made in one of two ways: in citation sentences or in citation clauses. In law review pieces, all citations appear in footnotes appended to the portions of the text to which they refer. For an explanation of citation sentences and clauses in practitioners’ documents, see
Bluepages B1
.
(a) Text.
Citations to authorities that support (or contradict) a proposition made in the main text (as opposed to footnote text) are placed in footnotes. A footnote call number should appear at the end of a textual sentence if the cited authority supports (or contradicts) the entire sentence. In contrast, a call number should appear within the sentence next to the portion it supports if the cited authority supports (or contradicts) only that part of the sentence. The call number comes after any punctuation mark—such as a comma, semicolon, or period—with the exception of a dash or a colon. In addition to citation to authorities, a footnote may include textual sentences that are related to the main text to which the footnote is appended:
This is sentence one.
1
Sentence two contains two call numbers;
2
however, only one of these — this one
3
— is surprising. Recall one thing
4
: call numbers precede dashes and colons.
(b) Footnotes.
If a footnote itself contains an assertion requiring support, a citation to the relevant authority should appear directly after the assertion as either a citation sentence or a citation clause.
(i) Citation sentences.
Authorities that support (or contradict) an entire footnote sentence are cited in a separate citation sentence immediately after the sentence they support (or contradict). The citation sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a period.
(ii) Citation clauses.
Authorities that support (or contradict) only part of a sentence within a footnote are cited in clauses, set off by commas, that immediately follow the proposition they support (or contradict).
(c) Example.
The following excerpt illustrates the use of citation sentences and clauses in a law review piece:
Some American jurisdictions place the burden of sustaining criminal defenses on the accused.
1
States have required defendants to prove both insanity
2
and self-defense.
3
In several jurisdictions the defendant must even establish that a homicide was accidental.

John Calvin Jeffries, Jr. & Paul B. Stephan III,
Defenses, Presumptions, and Burden of Proof in the Criminal Law

Yale L.J
. 1325, 1329–30 (1979). The authors point out that the use of affirmative defenses may relieve the state of its duty to prove a sufficient factual basis for punishment,

at 1357, and argue that the reasonable doubt standard should not be limited to those facts formally identified as elements of the offense charged,
id.
at 1327.
