Introductory Signals
(pp. 66–68)
(a) Signals that indicate support.
[no signal]
Cited authority (i) directly states the proposition, (ii) identifies the source of a quotation, or (iii) identifies an authority referred to in the text. Use no signal, for example, when directly quoting an authority or when restating numerical data from an authority.
E.g.
,
Cited authority states the proposition; other authorities also state the proposition, but citation to them would not be helpful or is not necessary. “
E.g.
,” may be used alone or attached to any other signal (whether supportive or not). When it is attached to another signal, it should be preceded by an italicized comma and followed by a non-italicized comma.
See, e.g.
,
But see, e.g.
,
Accord
“
Accord
” is commonly used when two or more sources state or clearly support the proposition, but the text quotes or refers to only one; the other sources are then introduced by “
accord
.” Similarly, the law of one jurisdiction may be cited as being in accord with the law of another.
See
Cited authority clearly supports the proposition. “
See
”
is used instead of “
[no signal]
” when the proposition is not directly stated by the cited authority but obviously follows from it; there is an inferential step between the authority cited and the proposition it supports.
See also
Cited authority constitutes additional source material that supports the proposition. “
See also
” is commonly used to cite an authority supporting a proposition when authorities that state or directly support the proposition already have been cited or discussed. The use of a parenthetical explanation of the source’s relevance (
rule 1.5
) following a citation introduced by “
see also
” is required.
Cf.
Cited authority supports a proposition different from the main proposition but sufficiently analogous to lend support. Literally, “
cf.
” means “
compare.
” The citation's relevance will usually be clear to the reader only if it is explained. Parenthetical explanations (
rule 1.5
), however brief, are therefore required.
(b) Signal that suggests a useful comparison or contrast.
Compare...
[and]...
with...
[and]...
Comparison of the authorities cited will offer support for or illustrate the proposition. When used as a signal, “
Compare
”
must be used in conjunction with “
with
”; the “
with
” is preceded by a comma, as is “
and
” when used. The relevance of the comparison will usually be clear to the reader only if it is explained. Parenthetical explanations (
rule 1.5
) following each authority are therefore required.
Contrast...        [and]...              with...              [and]...
The contrast between the authorities cited will offer support for or illustrate the proposition. When used as a signal, “
Contrast
” must be used in conjunction with “
with
”; the “
with
” is preceded by a comma, as is “
and
” when used. The relevance of the contrast will usually be clear to the reader only if it is explained. Parenthetical explanations (
rule 1.5
) following each authority are therefore required.
Compare
McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, 791 (2010) (plurality opinion) (incorporating the Second Amendment through the Due Process Clause),
with
Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U.S. 146, 150 (2019) (incorporating the Excessive Fines Clause through the Due Process Clause).
Contrast
Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U.S. 146, 150 (2019) (incorporating the Excessive Fines Clause through the Due Process Clause),
with
id.
at 157–58 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment) (reaching the same result through the Privileges or Immunities Clause).
(c) Signals that indicate contradiction.
Contra
Cited authority directly states the contrary of the proposition. “
Contra
” is used where “[
no signal
]” would be used for support.
But see
Cited authority clearly supports a proposition contrary to the main proposition. “
But see
” is used where “
see
” would be used for support.
But cf.
Cited authority supports a proposition analogous to the contrary of the main proposition. The use of a parenthetical explanation of the source’s relevance (
rule 1.5
) following a citation introduced by “
but cf
.
” is required.
“
But
” should be omitted from “
but see
” and “
but cf.
” whenever one of these signals follows another negative signal:
Contra
Blake v. Kline, 612 F.2d 718, 723–24 (3d Cir. 1979);
see
Charles Alan Wright, Law of Federal Courts (Students Edition)
§ 48 (4th ed. 1983).
(d) Signal that indicates background material.
See generally
Cited authority presents helpful background material related to the proposition. The use of a parenthetical explanation of the source material’s relevance (
rule 1.5
) following each authority introduced by “
see generally
” is required.
(e) Signals as verbs.
In footnotes, signals may be used as the verbs of textual sentences. When using signals in this way, include material that would otherwise be included in a parenthetical explanation as part of the sentence itself. Signals should not be italicized when used as verbs in textual sentences (
rule 2.1(d)
):

(f) Pincites.
Pincites are required for all citations except for those introduced by “
