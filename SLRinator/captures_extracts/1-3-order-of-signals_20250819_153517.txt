Order of Signals
(p.68)
When more than one signal is used, the signals (along with the authorities they introduce) should appear in the order in which those signals are listed in
rule 1.2
. When “
e.g.
,
” is used in conjunction with another signal, the other signal’s position in
rule 1.2
should be used. Note that the order of authorities within each signal must conform to
rule 1.4
. Signals of the same basic type—supportive, comparative, contradictory, or background (
rule 1.2(a)–(d)
)—must be strung together within a single citation sentence and separated by semicolons. Signals of different types, however, must be grouped in different citation sentences. For example:
See
Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307 (1976) (per curiam);
cf.
Palmer v. Ticcione, 433 F. Supp. 653 (E.D.N.Y. 1977) (upholding a mandatory retirement age for kindergarten teachers).
But see, e.g.
, Gault v. Garrison, 569 F.2d 993 (7th Cir. 1977) (holding that a classification of public school teachers based on age violated equal protection absent a showing of justifiable and rational state purpose).
See generally
Comment, O’Neil v. Baine
:
Application of Middle-Level Scrutiny to Old-Age Classifications
, 127
U. Pa. L. Rev.
798 (1979) (advocating a new constitutional approach to old-age classifications).
Within a citation clause (
rule 1.1
), however, citation strings may contain signals of more than one type, separated by semicolons.
