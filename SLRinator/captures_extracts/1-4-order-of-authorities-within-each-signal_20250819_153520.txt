Order of Authorities Within Each Signal
(p.69)
Authorities within each signal are separated by semicolons.
Authorities should be ordered in a logical manner. If one authority or several authorities together are considerably more helpful or authoritative than the other authorities cited within a signal, they should precede the others.
Authorities cited in short form are ordered as though cited in full.
