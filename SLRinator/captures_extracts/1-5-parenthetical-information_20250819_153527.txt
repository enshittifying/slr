Parenthetical Information
(pp. 69–71)
(a) Substantive information.
Use parentheticals, as needed, to explain the relevance of a particular authority to the proposition given in the text. Parenthetical information is required when the relevance of a cited authority might not otherwise be clear to the reader (see
rule 1.2
). Explanatory information takes the form of a present participial phrase, a quoted sentence, or a short statement that is appropriate in context.
(i) Phrases not quoting the authority.
Explanatory parenthetical phrases not directly quoting the authority usually begin with a present participle and should never begin with a capital letter:
See
generally
Akhil Reed Amar,
Reports of My Death Are Greatly Exaggerated: A Reply
, 138
U. Pa. L. Rev.
1651 (1990) (arguing that the author and the two-tier theory of federal jurisdiction are still viable).
When a complete participial phrase is unnecessary in context, a shorter parenthetical may be substituted:
Such standards have been adopted to address a variety of environmental problems.
See, e.g.

The New International Sanitary Regulations
, 46
Am. J. Int’l L.

for the UNESCO World Heritage Convention
, 2
Earth L.J.
45, 45–81 (1976) (conservation of protected areas).
You may omit extraneous words such as “the” unless doing so would cause confusion.
(ii) Phrases quoting the authority.
If, however, the parenthetical information quotes one or more full sentences or a portion of material that reads as a full sentence, it should begin with a capital letter and include appropriate closing punctuation. Indicate any omissions in the quoted text according to
rule 5.3(b)

When directly quoting only a short phrase from an authority, follow
rule 1.5(a)(i)
:
But see
Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 264 (1989) (explaining that the final judgment rule reduces the potential for parties to “clog the courts” with a succession of time-consuming appeals).
(b) Order of parentheticals within a citation.
When a citation requires multiple parentheticals, place them in the following order:
(date) [hereinafter short name] (en banc) (Lastname, J., concurring) (plurality opinion) (per curiam) (alteration in original) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted) (citations omitted) (quoting another source) (citing another source),
http://www.domainname.com
(last visited) (explanatory parenthetical), prior or subsequent history.
When a parenthetical includes a quotation that itself requires a parenthetical, nest the parentheticals:
Baze v. Rees, 553 U.S. 35, 48 (2008) (plurality opinion) (“This Court has
never
invalidated a State's chosen procedure for carrying out a sentence of death as the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.” (emphasis added)).
In citations to online sources that share the characteristics of a print source such that they could be cited according to
rule 18.2.1(b)(ii)
, the URL should immediately precede the explanatory parenthetical.
In citations to online and internet sources that utilize archival tools, the archival link should immediately follow the URL (
rule 18.2.1(d)
).
Note that explanatory parentheticals precede any citation of subsequent history or other related authority (
rule 1.6
):
Atl. Richfield Co. v. Fed. Energy Admin., 429 F. Supp. 1052, 1061–62 (N.D. Cal. 1976) (“[N]ot every person aggrieved by administrative action is necessarily entitled to the protections of due process.”),

, 556 F.2d 542 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1977).

If the material cited quotes or cites two or more different sources, include all sources in the order in which they were cited within one quoting or citing parenthetical. For two sources, use the format “
first . . .; and then . . .
”; for three or more sources, use “
first . . .; then . . .; and then . . .
” such that “
and then
” is always used for the last source.
