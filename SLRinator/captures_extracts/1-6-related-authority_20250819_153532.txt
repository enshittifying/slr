Related Authority
(pp. 71–72)
When citing a work, citations to related authorities may be helpful to aid in locating the primary work or to provide relevant information not reflected in the primary citation. Citations to related authority may be appended to the primary citation with the use of an italicized explanatory phrase.
(a) Related authority intended to increase access.
(i) “In.”
When citing a shorter work such as an article, essay, or speech originally published in a volume collecting such works, use “
in
” to introduce the collection as a whole (see
rule 15.5
):
Kay Deaux & Brenda Major,
A Social-Psychological Model of Gender
,
in
Theoretical Perspectives on Sexual Differences
89, 93 (Deborah L. Rhode ed., 1990).
(ii) “Reprinted in.”
A work that conveniently reprints a source originally published elsewhere may be introduced by “
reprinted in
.” As far as possible, provide a complete citation for the original work, followed by “
reprinted in
” and the citation for the volume containing the reprint (see
rule 15.5.2
):
Louis Loss,
The Conflict of Laws and the Blue Sky Laws
, 71
Harv. L. Rev
. 209 (1957),
reprinted in
Louis Loss & Edward M. Cowett, Blue Sky Law
180 (1958).
Thomas Jefferson, Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 and 1799,
reprinted
in
4
The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution
540 (Jonathan Elliot ed., 2d ed., Philadelphia, J.B. Lippincott 1888).
To indicate excerpts or partial reprints, add the word “
as
”:
S. Rep. No
. 95-181, at 14 (1977),
as reprinted in
1977 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3401, 3414.
(iii) Other phrases.
Other phrases may be used by analogy to
rule 1.6(a)(i)
and
(ii)
, as appropriate (e.g., “
microformed on
” (see
rule 18.6.1
) or “
translated in
” (see
rule 20.2.5
)).
(b) Relevant history.
The prior or subsequent history of a case (
rule 10.7
) or of a statute (
rule 12.7
) may be appended to the main citation for that case or statute. See
rules 10.7
and
12.7
for circumstances in which the subsequent history of a case or statute
must
be indicated:
Matthews v. Konieczny, 488 A.2d 5 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1985),
rev’d
, 527 A.2d 508 (Pa. 1987).
(c) Commentary.
Works that discuss or quote the primary authority may also be appended to the citation without parentheses as related authorities when particularly relevant or when locating the original source may be difficult. Use italicized phrases such as “
noted in
,” “
construed in
,” “
quoted in
,” “
reviewed by
,” “
cited with approval in
,” and “
questioned in
” to introduce these works. Works that the primary authority discusses, cites, or otherwise mentions, however, should be indicated parenthetically. Thus:
Filled Milk Act § 1, 21 U.S.C. § 61 (2006),
construed
in
Milnot Co. v. Richardson, 350 F. Supp. 221 (S.D. Ill. 1972).
But:
Milnot Co. v. Richardson, 350 F. Supp. 221 (S.D. Ill. 1972) (construing Filled Milk Act § 1, 21 U.S.C. § 61).
