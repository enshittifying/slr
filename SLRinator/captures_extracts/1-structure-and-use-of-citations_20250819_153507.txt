Structure and Use of Citations
(p.65)
Provide citations to authorities so that readers may identify and find those authorities for future research. Citations are made in citation sentences and clauses (
rule 1.1
) and are introduced by signals. Signals organize authorities and show how those authorities support or relate to a proposition given in the text (
rule 1.2
). Citation sentences and clauses may contain more than one signal. Order signals according to
rule 1.3
. Within each signal, arrange authorities according to
rule 1.4
. Parentheticals may be necessary to explain the relevance of a particular authority to the proposition given in the text (
rule 1.5
). Certain additional information, specific to that authority, may also be appended according to
rule 1.6
.
