10.2
Case Names
(pp. 101–07)
The only significant differences between case names in textual sentences and case names in citations are the italicization (
rule 2
) and the extent to which the case name is abbreviated. The provisions of
rule 10.2.1
apply to every case name, whether in text or citations, but case names in citations are further abbreviated according to
rule 10.2.2
. Thus:
In
Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen
, 244 U.S. 205 (1917), Justice McReynolds stressed the value of uniform laws.
Southern Pacific
also indicates the breadth of federal lawmaking power under the admiralty jurisdiction.
Not:
In
S. Pac. Co. v. Jensen
, 244 U.S. 205 (1917), Justice McReynolds stressed the value of uniform laws.
But:
in citations:
See, e.g.
, S. Pac. Co. v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205, 225–26 (1917) (Pitney, J., dissenting).
Note that the examples throughout
rule 10.2
employ the typeface conventions for law review citations. For an explanation of typeface conventions, see
rule 2
. For typeface conventions in court documents and legal memoranda, see
Bluepages B2
.
10.2.1 –
General Rules for Case Names
Use the case name that appears at the beginning of the opinion in the cited reporter as modified by the paragraphs below. If no name appears in the cited reporter, use a popular name or cite as “
Judgment of
<date>
”:
Shelley's Case
Judgment of Oct. 11, 2008
Always retain in full the first word in each party’s name (including a relator) except as provided below. In extremely long case names, omit words not necessary for identification; the running head (the short identifier printed at the top of each page of the case) may serve as a guide. Make the following modifications where applicable:
(a) Actions and parties cited.
If the case is a consolidation of two or more actions, cite only the first listed:
Shelley v. Kraemer
Not:
Shelley v. Kraemer, McGhee v. Sipes
Note that a number of famous, early cases  contain a turned comma, not an apostrophe, in a party's name:
M‘Culloch v. Maryland
Not:
M’Culloch v. Maryland
Omit all parties other than the first listed on each side. Do not omit the first-listed relator or any portion of a partnership name:
Fry v. Mayor of Sierra Vista
Not:
Fry v. Mayor & City Council of Sierra Vista
But:
Massachusetts
ex rel.
Alison v. Pauly
Eisen v. Spradlin, Lincoln & Amorosi
Omit words indicating multiple parties, such as “
et al.
” Also omit alternative names given for the first-listed party on either side:
Cheng v. Seinfeld
Not:
Cheng et al. v. Seinfeld d/b/a The Man, Inc.
Similarly, for in rem jurisdiction cases, omit all but the first-listed item or group of items:
In re
Three Pink Cadillacs
Not:
In re
Three Pink Cadillacs, Two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree
Where real property is a party, use its common street address, if available:
United States v. 6109 Grubb Road
Not:
United States v. Parcel of Real Property Known as 6109 Grubb Road, Millcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania
In bankruptcy and similar cases, the case name might contain both an adversary and a nonadversary name. If both appear at the beginning of the opinion, cite the adversary name first, followed by the nonadversary name in parentheses. Include a procedural phrase such as “
In re
” or “
ex rel.
” before the nonadversary name, followed by a descriptive or introductory phrase such as “
Estate of
” or “
Interest of
,” if any. If only an adversary name or only a nonadversary name appears at the beginning of the opinion, cite the name supplied:
Wallingford’s, Inc. v. Waning (
In re
Waning), 120 B.R. 607, 611 (Bankr. D. Me. 1990).
In re
Drexel Burnham Lambert Grp., Inc., 120 B.R. 724 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1990).
In re
Estate of Benson, No. C7-95-2185, 1996 WL 118367 (Minn. Ct. App. Mar. 19, 1996).
State v. Powers (
In re
Interest of Powers), 493 N.W.2d 167 (Neb. 1992).
(b) Procedural phrases.

,” “
as next friend of
,” and similar expressions to “
ex rel
.
” Abbreviate “
in the matter of
,” “
petition of
,” “
application of
,” and similar expressions to “
In re
.
” Omit all procedural phrases except the first. When adversary parties are named, omit all procedural phrases except “
ex rel
.
”:
Gorman v. Bruh
Not:
In re
Gorman v. Bruh
But:
Massachusetts
ex rel.
Kennedy v. Armbruster
Ex parte
Young
Include any introductory or descriptive phrases such as “
Accounting of
,” “
Estate of
,” and “
Will of
.” Thus:
In re
Will of Holt
Estate of Haas v. Commissioner
Procedural phrases should always be italicized, regardless of whether the rest of the case name is italicized. Thus, in law review text:
Ex parte
Young
(c) Abbreviations.
In textual sentences, whether in main text or in footnote text, abbreviate only widely known acronyms under
rule 6.1(b)
and these eight words: “
&
,” “
Ass’n
,” “
Bros.
,” “
Co.
,” “
Corp.
,” “
Inc.
,” “
Ltd.
,” and “
No.
” If one of these eight begins a party’s name, however, do not abbreviate it:

PECO v. Hirsch
But:
NAACP v. Kaminski

rule 10.2.2

The King
” or “
The Queen
” is a party. Thus:
Mia. Herald v. Sercus
But:
In re
The Clinton Bridge
The King v. Broadrup
Do not omit “
The
” in an established popular name, except when referring to the case textually. Thus:
See
The Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3 (1883).
But:
Neither of the
Civil Rights Cases
opinions was correct.
Not:
Neither of

opinions was correct.

(f) Geographical terms.
Omit “
State of
,” “
Commonwealth of
,” and “

Commonwealth
,” or “

” should be retained:
Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U.S. 299 (1990).
Not:
Blystone v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 494 U.S. 299 (1990).
But:
Commonwealth v. Ferrone, 448 A.2d 637 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1982).
Omit “
City of
,” “
County of
,” “
Village of
,” “

,” and like expressions unless the expression begins a party name:
Mayor of New York v. Clinton
Not:
Mayor of the City of New York v. Clinton
But:
Butts v. City of New York
Omit all prepositional phrases of location not following “
City
,” or like expressions, unless the omission would leave only one word in the name of a party or the location is part of the full name of a business or similar entity:
Surrick v. Board of Wardens
Not:
Surrick v. Board of Wardens of the Port of Philadelphia
But:
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey
Not:
Planned Parenthood v. Casey
Shapiro v. Bank of Harrisburg
Eimers v. Mutual of Omaha
Include designations of national or larger geographical areas except in union names (
rule 10.2.1(i)
). Omit “

” after “

”:
Flatow v. Islamic Republic of Iran
United States v. Aluminum Co. of America
Retain all geographical designations not introduced by a preposition:
Billman v. Indiana Department of Corrections
Omit all geographical designations that follow a comma:
City of Arlington v. FCC
Not:

(g) Given names or initials.
Generally, omit given names or initials of individuals, but not in names of business firms or where a party’s surname is abbreviated:

Not:
Paul Vincent Courtney v. Joseph S. Sandman
But:
Tanya Bartucz, Inc. v. Virginia J. Wise & Co.
Linda R.S. v. Richard D.
Do not omit any part of a surname made up of more than one word:
Van der Velt v. Standing Horse
Abdul Ghani v. Subedar Shoedar Khan
Given names that follow a surname should be retained. Thus, retain the full name where the name is
entirely
in a language in which the surname is given first, such as Chinese, Korean, or Vietnamese:
Yao Zhen Guang v. Yeh Zhi An
Chow v. Ha Quang Jin
Not:
Timothy Chow v. Ha Quang Jin
Similarly, if a party’s name is of Spanish or Portuguese derivation, cite the surname and all names following:
Ortega y Gasset v. Alcala de Larosa
If in doubt, use the name under which the party appears in the index of the reporter cited.
(h) Business firm designations.
Omit “
Inc.
,” “
Ltd.
,” “
L.L.C.

Ass’n
,” “
Bros.
,” “
Co.
,” “
Corp.
,” “
Ins.
,” or “
R.R.
,” clearly indicating that the party is a business firm:
Wisconsin Packing Co. v. Indiana Refrigerator Lines, Inc.
Not:
Wisconsin Packing Co., Inc. v. Indiana Refrigerator Lines, Inc.
This rule should be read narrowly.  The omission of the business firm designation is appropriate only if the name of the business could not
possibly
be mistaken for the name of some other entity, such as a natural person.
(i) Union and local union names.
Cite a union name exactly as given in the official reporter. This general rule is subject, however, to the following exceptions:
(i) Only the smallest unit should be cited:
NLRB v. Radio & Television Broadcast Engineers Local 1212
Not:
NLRB v. Radio & Television Broadcast Engineers Local 1212, IBEW, AFL-CIO
(ii) All craft or industry designations, except the first
full
such designation, should be omitted:
Douds v. Local 294, International Brotherhood of Teamsters
Not:
Douds v. Local 294, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers
But:
International Union of Doll & Toy Workers v. Local 379
(iii) A widely recognized abbreviation of the union’s name (e.g.,
UAW
) may be used in accordance with
rules 6.1(b)
and
10.2.1(c)
.
(iv) All prepositional phrases of location, including those of national or larger areas, should be omitted.
(j) Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
Cite simply as “
Commissioner
” or, in citations, “
Comm’r
.”
(k) Common names different from name in reporter.
For cases not known by the name that appears in the reporter, but known instead by a common name, the common name must either be substituted for the reporter name in its entirety, or indicated parenthetically in the same typeface as the case name in the reporter:
The Brig Amy Warwick (The Prize Cases), 67 U.S. (2 Black) 635 (1863).
The Prize Cases, 67 U.S. (2 Black) 635 (1863).
Not:
The Prize Cases (The Brig Amy Warwick), 67 U.S. (2 Black) 635 (1863).
For cases known by the name in the reporter, but also commonly known by a
short
name different from that appearing in the reporter, the common name may
not
be substituted for the reporter name in its entirety in a full citation, but it may be indicated parenthetically in
italics
:
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (
Steel Seizure
), 343 U.S. 579 (1952).
Not:
Steel Seizure
, 343 U.S. 579 (1952).
Similarly, for mandamus actions against courts where the case is known by the name of the judge against whom the writ is sought, the name may be indicated parenthetically in
italics
:
United States v. U.S. District Court (
Keith
), 407 U.S. 297 (1972).
And, for cases with multiple dispositions, a helpful identifier of the number of the decision may be indicated parenthetically in
italics
:
Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (
Hamdi III
), 316 F.3d 450 (4th Cir. 2003).
This parenthetical identifier is given only when a case is cited as the primary citation. Once given, the parenthetical identifier alone may be used as the case name when the case is cited again, even in circumstances where a full citation would otherwise be required:
1
Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. FCC (
Fox I
), 280 F.3d 1027 (D.C. Cir.),
modified on reh’g
, 293 F.3d 537 (D.C. Cir. 2002).
2
Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. FCC (
Fox II
), 293 F.3d 537, 540 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting
Fox I
, 280 F.3d at 1043).
In conformity with
rule 2.1(f)
, when citing cases according to the above rule, the parentheses themselves should never be italicized in either main text or footnote text.
10.2.2 –
Additional Rules for Case Names in Citations
Cite case names in citations according to the rules given above, but with the following further modifications:
Always abbreviate any word listed in
table T6
, even if the word is the first word in a party’s name, unless the word is part of a state, country, or other geographical unit that is the entire name of the party:
S. Consol. R.R. v. Consol. Transp. Co.
In re
Acad. Answering Serv., Inc.
McGaugh v. Comm’r
But:
South Dakota v. Dole
Not:
S. Dakota v. Dole
Abbreviate states, countries, and other geographical units as indicated in
table T10
unless the geographical unit is the entire name of the party (as opposed to just a part thereof). This includes “
United States
.” Thus:
In re
W. Tex. Pepper Co.
LeBeau v. Univ. of Md.
But:
Staub v. District of Columbia
Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Stud. v. U.S. Dep’t of Just.
But:
Alvarez-Machain v. United States
But:
Fritz v. County of Los Angeles
Abbreviate other words of eight letters or more if
substantial
space
is thereby saved and the result is unambiguous.
When the textual sentence mentions the case name in full, the case name may be omitted from the citation.
