Reporters and Other Sources
(pp. 108–10)
10.3.1 –
Parallel Citations and Which Source(s) to Cite
The federal and state jurisdictions table (
table T1
) indicates which reporters to cite for the decisions of most courts. Note that many state court decisions are published in two or more sources.
(a) Parallel citations in state court documents.
In documents submitted to state courts, all case citations must be to the source(s) required by local rules. Many state rules require that citations to state court decisions include a citation to the official state reporter,
followed
by a parallel citation to a regional reporter. Thus, these local rules, and
not
the citation rules set forth in
table T1
, govern state court filings. See
Bluepages B10.1.3
and
Bluepages table BT2.2
for further guidance concerning jurisdiction-specific citation rules.
(b) Case citations in all other documents.
In all other documents, including
ordinary legal memoranda
and
law review pieces
, cite the relevant regional reporter, if the decision is found therein. For example:
Swedloff v. Phila. Transp. Co., 187 A.2d 152 (Pa. 1963).
If the decision is available as an official public domain citation (also referred to as medium-neutral citation), that citation must be provided, as well as a parallel citation to the regional reporter, if available.
If the decision is not found in a regional reporter or available as a public domain citation, cite the other sources indicated in
table T1
. Cite decisions of unlisted courts as you would those of courts listed in the table. If a case is not available in an official or preferred unofficial reporter or as a public domain citation, cite another unofficial reporter, a widely used computer database (
rule 18.4
), a service (
rule 19
), a slip opinion (
rule 10.8.1(b)
), an internet source (
rule 18.2.2
), or a newspaper (
rule 16.6
), in that order of preference:
United States v. Carlisle, No. 90-2465SI, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 5863, at *3 (8th Cir. Apr. 10, 1991) (per curiam).
In re
Smithfield Estates, Inc., [1985–1986 Transfer Binder] Bankr. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶ 70,707 (Bankr. D.R.I. Aug. 9, 1985).
Simmons v. Brothers, No. 90-627 (D. Mass. Dec. 19, 1990).
State v. McArthur, No. C4-99-502 (Minn. Ct. App. Sep. 28, 1999),
https://mn.gov/law-library-stat/archive/ctapun/9909/502.htm
.
United States v. Palermo,
N.Y. Times
, Aug. 27, 1957, at 24 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 1957).
For citation to administrative reporters, see
rule 14.3.2
.
10.3.2 –
Reporters
Bound publications that print only cases (or cases and annotations) are considered reporters and are cited in roman type. A citation to a reporter consists of a volume designation (
rule 3.1
), the abbreviated name of the reporter (as shown in
table T1
), and the page on which the case report begins (
rule 3.2
). For rules on spacing in reporter abbreviations, see
rule 6.1(a)
:
Burt v. Rumsfeld, 322 F. Supp. 2d 189 (D. Conn. 2004).
Early American reporters were often named after their editors rather than after the courts whose cases they reported. Subsequently, official editor-named series have been combined into jurisdiction-named series with continuous volume numbering. Such reporters are now generally cited by the official series name and number only; the name of the reporter’s editor is omitted:
Cobb v. Davenport, 32 N.J.L. 369 (Sup. Ct. 1867).
Not:
Cobb v. Davenport, 3 Vroom 369 (Sup. Ct. 1867).
However, for United States Supreme Court reporters through 90 U.S. (23 Wall.) and a few early state reporters (see
table T1.3
), give the name of the reporter’s editor and the volume of that series. If the pagination of the official jurisdiction-named reprints and the original reporters is the same, use the following form:
Green v. Biddle, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 1 (1823).
Hall v. Bell, 47 Mass. (6 Met.) 431 (1843).
If the pagination differs, give parallel citations to the reprints and the original reporters:
Wadsworth v. Ruggles, 23 Mass. 62, 6 Pick. 63 (1828).
Some very early Pennsylvania federal and state court decisions are reported in the initial volumes of the
United States Reports
. Where such reporting occurs, include the cite to “
U.S.
,” along with a parallel cite to the appropriate lower court reporter:
Barnes’s Lessee v. Irwin, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 199, 1 Yeates 221 (Pa. 1793).
United States v. Fries, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 515, 9 F. Cas. 826 (C.C.D. Pa. 1799) (No. 5126).
10.3.3 –
Public Domain Format
When citing a decision available in public domain format (also referred to as medium-neutral format), if the jurisdiction’s format can be cited in the following form (see
table T7
), provide the case name, the year of decision, the state’s two-character postal code, the
table T7
court abbreviation (unless the court is the state’s highest court), the sequential number of the decision, and, if the decision is unpublished, a capital “
U
” after the sequential number of the decision. When referencing specific material within the decision, a pinpoint citation should be made to the paragraph number at which the material appears. If available, a parallel citation to the appropriate regional reporter must be provided.
The following examples are representative of the recommended public domain citation format:
Beck v. Beck, 1999 ME 110, ¶ 6, 733 A.2d 981, 983.
Gregory v. Class, 1998 SD 106, ¶ 3, 584 N.W.2d 873, 875.
Jones v. Fisher, 1998 OK Civ. App. 120U.
If a jurisdiction adopts a public domain format that differs from the above, the requirements of the jurisdiction’s format should be observed (
table T1
):
Cannon v. Am. Bowling Cong., 94-0647, p. 1 (La. 4/29/94), 637 So. 2d 463, 463.
Morton v. New Orleans Police Dep’t, 96-1799 (La. App. 4 Cir. 2/5/97), 687 So. 2d 699.
Sullivan v. State, 98-KA-00521-SCT (¶ 23) (Miss. 1999).
State v. Brennan, 1998-NMCA-176, ¶ 7, 126 N.M. 389, 970 P.2d 161.
