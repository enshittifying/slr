Court and Jurisdiction
(pp. 110–11)
Every case citation must indicate which court decided the case. In American and other common law citations, give the name of the court and its geographical jurisdiction (abbreviated according to
tables T1
or
T2
if included therein and according to
tables T7
and
T10
in all other cases) in the parenthetical phrase that immediately follows the citation and includes the date or year of decision.  For court names that include ordinals, format and abbreviate the ordinals in accordance with
rule 6.2(b)
:
Commonwealth v. Virelli, 620 A.2d 543 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1992).
United States v. Andolschek, 142 F.2d 503 (2d Cir. 1944).

and
table T2
.
A more detailed court designation than those specified by the following paragraphs may be given if necessary.
(a) Federal courts.
In citations to
United States Law Week
, the United States Supreme Court is indicated with “
U.S.
” In citations to the
Supreme Court Reporter
and the
United States Reports
, omit the Supreme Court’s name. When a Supreme Court Justice sits on a lower court in his or her capacity as a Circuit Justice, cite the decision as:
Redden v. Interstate Com. Comm’n, 956 F.2d 302 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (Thomas, Circuit Justice).
United States courts of appeals for numbered circuits, regardless of year, are indicated as:
2d Cir.
Not:
C.C.A.2d
Not:
CA2
When citing the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and its predecessors, or when citing the Federal Circuit, use the following abbreviations:
D.C. Cir.
Fed. Cir.
For district court cases, give the district but not the division:
D.N.J.
D.D.C.
C.D. Cal.
Not:
C.D. Cal. E.D.
Cite the old circuit courts (abolished 1912):
C.C.S.D.N.Y.
C.C.E.D. Mo.
Cite the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation:
J.P.M.L.
Cite the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and Court of Review, respectively:
F.I.S.C., F.I.S.C.R.
Cite decisions of bankruptcy courts and bankruptcy appellate panels:
Bankr. E.D. Va.
B.A.P. 9th Cir.
(b) State courts.
In general, indicate the state and court of decision. However, do not include the name of the court if the court of decision is the highest court of the state:
People v. Armour, 590 N.W.2d 61 (Mich. 1999).
Not:
People v. Armour, 590 N.W.2d 61 (Mich. Sup. Ct. 1999).
Omit the jurisdiction and/or the court abbreviation if unambiguously conveyed by the reporter title:
DiLucia v. Mandelker, 493 N.Y.S.2d 769 (App. Div. 1985).
Not:
DiLucia v. Mandelker, 493 N.Y.S.2d 769 (N.Y. App. Div. 1985).
Dubreuil v. Witt, 80 Conn. App. 410 (2003).
Not:
Dubreuil v. Witt, 80 Conn. App. 410 (App. Ct. 2003).
Thus, when a decision is rendered by the highest court in a particular jurisdiction and the name of the reporter is the same as the name of that jurisdiction, neither the name of the court nor the name of the state need be given:
Bates v. Tappan, 99 Mass. 376 (1868).
Do not indicate the department, district, or county in citing decisions of intermediate state courts unless that information is of particular relevance:
Schiffman v. Corsi, 50 N.Y.S.2d 897 (Sup. Ct. 1944).
When the department, district, or county is of particular relevance, that information should be indicated as follows:
Schiffman v. Corsi, 50 N.Y.S.2d 897 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty. 1944).
Lee v. Perez, 120 S.W.3d 463 (Tex. App. 14th 2003).
