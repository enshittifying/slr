CONTENT:
10.5
Date or Year
(p.112)
(a) Decisions published in reporters.
If possible, provide the year of decision; use the year of the term of the court only if the year of decision is unavailable. In ambiguous cases, follow the year given in the running head (at the top of each page) in the reporter. Before Volume 108 of the U.S. Reports (1882), opinions do not usually list their date of decision but rather list only the term in which they were decided.  For the dates of these opinions, refer to the Librarian of the Supreme Court's list of dates, available at
http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/datesofdecisions.pdf
.
(b) Decisions published in other sources.
Give the exact date for all unreported cases and for all cases cited to a looseleaf service, a slip opinion, an electronic database, or a newspaper:
Bedell v. Nessim, No. 90-567, slip op. 3458 (1st Cir. Jan. 19, 1991).
Per
rule 10.5(a)
, the exact date is
not
necessary for cases that are labeled “unpublished” but are nevertheless reported, including cases reported in the
Federal Appendix
and “unpublished” cases reported in the appropriate reporter for the jurisdiction:
United States v. Tando, 68 F. App’x 85 (9th Cir. 2003).
(c) Pending cases and cases dismissed without opinion.
Use the date or year of the most recent major disposition. “Major dispositions” include
only
: the initial filing, whether in the trial court or on appeal (e.g., “
filed
,” “
appeal docketed
,” “
petition for cert. filed
”), oral argument (“
argued
”), and, for cases dismissed without opinion, the dismissal (“
dismissed
”). Indicate the significance of the date within a parenthetical phrase, unless its significance is explained elsewhere:
Bedell v. Nessim, No. 90-567 (1st Cir. argued Jan. 10, 1991).
Otherwise no special notation is necessary:
Bedell v. Nessim, 725 F. Supp. 1407 (D. Mass. 1990),
appeal docketed
, No. 90-567 (1st Cir. Dec. 20, 1990).
(d) Multiple decisions within a single year.
When citing a case with several different decisions in the same year, include the year only with the last-cited decision in that year:
United States v. Eller, 114 F. Supp. 284 (M.D.N.C.),
rev’d
, 208 F.2d 716 (4th Cir. 1953).
However, if the exact date of decision is required in either case, include both dates:
DiNapoli v. Ne. Reg’l Parole Comm’n, 764 F.2d 143 (2d Cir. 1985),
petition for cert. filed
, 54 U.S.L.W. 3146 (U.S. Aug. 29, 1985) (No. 85-335).
