Parenthetical Information Regarding Cases
(pp. 113–14)
10.6.1 –
Weight of Authority
(a) Generally.
Information regarding the weight of the authority (e.g.,
en banc
;
in banc
;
2-1 decision
;
mem.
;
per curiam
;
Brandeis, J.
;
unpublished table decision
) may be added in a separate parenthetical phrase following the date of decision:
Webb v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 57 F.3d 1067 (4th Cir. 1995) (unpublished table decision).
When a case is cited for a proposition that is not the single, clear holding of a majority of the court (e.g.,
alternative holding
;
by implication
;
dictum
;
dissenting opinion
;
plurality opinion
;
holding unclear
), indicate that fact parenthetically:
Parker v. Randolph, 442 U.S. 62, 84 (1979) (Stevens, J., dissenting).
Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 570 (1985) (5-4 decision) (Powell, J., dissenting).
Information regarding related authority (
rule 1.6
) or prior or subsequent history (
rule 10.7.1(a)
) that can properly be indicated with an explanatory phrase (
table T8
) should not be given parenthetically. Thus:
Wersba v. Seiler, 393 F.2d 937 (3d Cir. 1968) (per curiam).
But:
Wersba v. Seiler, 263 F. Supp. 838, 843 (E.D. Pa. 1967),
aff’d per curiam
, 393 F.2d 937 (3d Cir. 1968).
(b) “
Mem.
” and “
per curiam.
”
The abbreviation “
mem.
” stands for the word “
memorandum
” and should be used in a parenthetical if, and only if, a court disposition was issued without an opinion. District court and other opinions denominated “
memorandum decision
” are not designated “
mem.
” in citations. The phrase “
per curiam
” refers to an opinion issued “
by the court
” as an institution as opposed to a decision issued by a particular judge. “
Per curiam
” is used in a parenthetical to describe an opinion so denominated by the court.
(c) Seriatim opinions.
Early in its history, the U.S. Supreme Court followed the traditional British practice of each Justice writing his own opinion rather than producing a majority opinion for the Court. To cite such an opinion, include the parenthetical “
(opinion of Lastname, J.)
.”
10.6.2 –
In-Chambers Opinions
When a Supreme Court Justice rules on a stay, bail, or injunction application, he or she makes that decision "in-chambers" as a "surrogate" of the whole Court. Only a few of those decisions result in written opinions, and all have been published in the U.S. Reports only since Volume 396 in 1969. To cite such an opinion, include the parenthetical "
(Lastname, J., in chambers)
".
(a) Pre-1969 opinions.
These have been gathered by Cynthia Rapp and published in a multi-volume set,
In Chambers Opinions by the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States
, that also includes the opinions written after 1969. Some of the pre-1969 cases did not appear in the U.S. Reports, so Rapp should be consulted first. Use this source and format only for opinions that cannot be found in the U.S. Reports:
Sacco v. Massachusetts, 1 Rapp 16 (1927) (Holmes, J., in chambers).
(b) U.S. Reports.
Since 1969, these opinions have been included in the U.S. Reports:
Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers).
10.6.3 –
Quoting/Citing Parentheticals in Case Citations
When a case cited as authority itself quotes or cites another case for that point, a “
quoting
” or “
citing
” parenthetical is appropriate per
rule 1.5(a)
. Within the parenthetical, the same rules regarding typeface, pincites, and short forms apply to the quoted or cited authority as if it were the direct source:
Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 719 (2001) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (citing Shaughnessy v. United States
ex rel.
Mezei, 345 U.S. 206 (1953)).
Note, however, that only one level of recursion is required. Thus, if a case quotes a case that itself quotes another case, only one level of “
quoting
” or “
citing
” parentheticals is necessary. An additional level of parenthetical information may be used if the information conveyed is particularly relevant.
10.6.4 –
Order of Parentheticals
Parenthetical phrases should be placed in the following order: (i) weight of authority parentheticals; (ii) “
quoting
” and “
citing
” parentheticals; (iii) explanatory parentheticals. For more detailed information, see
rule 1.5(b)
. Thus:
Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 47 (1949) (Rutledge, J., dissenting) (rejecting the Court’s conception of the exclusionary rule),
aff’g
, 187 P.2d 926 (Colo. 1947),
overruled by
, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961).
If an explanatory parenthetical contains text that
itself
requires a “quoting” or “citing” parenthetical, the two parentheticals should be nested:
Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407, 409 (2002) (“[T]he statutory criterion for confinement embodied in the statute’s words ‘mental abnormality or personality disorder’ satisfied ‘“substantive” due process requirements.’” (quoting Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 356 (1997))).
Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 519 (1980) (Marshall, J., concurring) (noting that conventional strict scrutiny is “strict in theory, but fatal in fact” (citing Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 362 (1978))).
