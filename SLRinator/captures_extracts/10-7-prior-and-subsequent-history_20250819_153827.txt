Prior and Subsequent History
(pp. 114–17)
Whenever a decision is cited in full, give the entire
subsequent
history of the case, but omit denials of certiorari or denials of similar discretionary appeals, unless the decision is less than two years old or the denial is particularly relevant. Omit also the history on remand or any denial of a rehearing, unless relevant to the point for which the case is cited. Finally, omit any disposition withdrawn by the deciding authority, such as an affirmance followed by reversal on rehearing. Thus:
Cent. Ill. Pub. Serv. Co. v. Westervelt, 342 N.E.2d 463 (Ill. App. Ct. 1976),
aff’d
, 367 N.E.2d 661 (Ill. 1977).
Not:
Cent. Ill. Pub. Serv. Co. v. Westervelt, 342 N.E.2d 463 (Ill. App. Ct. 1976),
aff’d
, 367 N.E.2d 661 (Ill. 1977),
cert. denied
, 434 U.S. 1070 (1978).
Cheng v. GAF Corp., 631 F.2d 1052 (2d Cir. 1980),
vacated
, 450 U.S. 903 (1981).
Not:
Cheng v. GAF Corp., 631 F.2d 1052 (2d Cir. 1980),
vacated
, 450 U.S. 903,
remanded to
,
659 F.2d 1058 (2d Cir. 1981).
Give
prior
history only if significant to the point for which the case is cited or if the disposition cited does not intelligibly describe the issues in the case, as in a Supreme Court “
mem.
” Give separate decisions of other issues in the case with their prior and subsequent history only if relevant.
10.7.1 –
Explanatory Phrases and Weight of Authority
A partial list of explanatory phrases (as abbreviated) appears in
table T8
.
(a) Prior or subsequent history.
Append the prior or subsequent history of a case to the primary citation. Introduce and explain each prior or subsequent decision with italicized words between each citation:
Cooper v. Dupnik, 924 F.2d 1520, 1530 & n.20 (9th Cir. 1991),
rev’d en banc
, 963 F.2d 1220 (9th Cir. 1992).
If a subsequent disposition occurred in the same year as the primary citation, omit the year from the primary citation’s parenthetical.
If subsequent history itself has subsequent history, append the additional subsequent history with another explanatory phrase. For example, in the following case the Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit, which had reversed the Southern District of New York:
Herbert v. Lando, 73 F.R.D. 387 (S.D.N.Y.),
rev’d
, 568 F.2d 974 (2d Cir. 1977),
rev’d
, 441 U.S. 153 (1979).
To show both prior and subsequent history, give the prior history first:
Kubrick v. United States, 581 F.2d 1092 (3d Cir. 1978),
aff’g
,
435 F. Supp. 166 (E.D. Pa. 1977),
rev’d
, 444 U.S. 111 (1979).
Citations to prior or subsequent history should follow any parenthetical information given for the primary citation (
rule 1.5(b)
).
(b) Significance of disposition.
Give the reason for a disposition if the disposition does not carry the normal substantive significance:
vacated as moot
,
appeal dismissed per stipulation
,
(c) Overruled, abrogated, and superseded cases.
Also note cases that have been overruled, abrogated, or superseded by statute or constitutional amendment:
(i) Overruled cases.
Indicate cases where a later decision by the same court (or a court with appellate jurisdiction over the original court)
explicitly
repudiates its earlier decision with the phrase “
overruled by
,
”:
Nat’l League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976),
overruled by
,
Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528 (1985).
Also, when one case is overruled by multiple subsequent decisions by the same court (i.e., separate decisions overrule separate parts of the holding), include “
and
,
” in italics between the citations to each of the overruling cases:
Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928),
overruled by
, Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967),
and
,
Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967).
(ii) Abrogated cases.
Cases that are effectively (but not explicitly) overruled or departed from by a later decision of the same court are indicated with the phrase “
abrogated by
,
”:
Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U.S. 188 (1948),
abrogated
by
, Braden v. 30th Jud. Cir. Ct., 410 U.S. 484 (1973).
(iii) Cases superseded by statute or constitutional amendment.
When citing cases where a statute or amendment was enacted with the specific intent of reversing the outcome of the initial case, the statute or amendment
must
always be cited, and a later case recognizing such
may
be cited for support, as long as the later case is decided by the same court (or a court with appellate jurisdiction over the original court) as the superseded case:
Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642 (1989),
superseded by statute
, Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1074,
as recognized in
, Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44 (2003).
Statutes cited according to this rule should be cited to the session laws (
rule 12.4
) wherever possible, and, if appropriate, specific sections of the statute superseding the case may be cited.
(d) Slave Cases.
For cases involving an enslaved person as a party, use the parenthetical “
(enslaved party)
.” For cases involving an enslaved person as the subject of a property or other legal dispute but not named as a party to the suit, use the parenthetical “
(enslaved person at issue)
.” For other cases involving enslaved persons, use an
adequately descriptive
parenthetical:
Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857) (enslaved party),
superseded by constitutional amendment
,
U.S. Const.
amend
. XIV.
Wall v. Wall, 30 Miss. 91 (1855) (enslaved person at issue).
(e) Multiple dispositions.
Multiple dispositions by the same court following a primary case citation should be connected with the word “
and
” in italics:
United States v. Baxter, 492 F.2d 150 (9th Cir.),
cert. dismissed
, 414 U.S. 801 (1973),
and cert. denied
, 416 U.S. 940 (1974).
10.7.2 –
Different Case Name on Appeal
(a) Name changes in subsequent history.
When the name of a case differs in subsequent history, the new name must be given, introduced by the phrase “
sub nom.
,
”:
Great W. United Corp. v. Kidwell, 577 F.2d 1256 (5th Cir. 1978),
rev’d sub nom.
, Leroy v. Great W. United Corp., 443 U.S. 173 (1979).
This rule applies even when the difference in the name is slight, such as a change in only the procedural phrases:
Padilla
ex rel.
Newman v. Rumsfeld, 243 F. Supp. 2d 42 (S.D.N.Y.),
aff’d in part, rev’d in part sub nom.
, Padilla v. Rumsfeld, 352 F.3d 695 (2d Cir. 2003),
rev’d
, 542 U.S. 426 (2004).
(b) Name changes in prior history.
To indicate a different name in prior history, use the following form:
Rederi v. Isbrandtsen Co., 342 U.S. 950 (1952) (per curiam),
aff’g by an equally divided court
, Isbrandtsen Co. v. United States, 96 F. Supp. 883 (S.D.N.Y. 1951).
(c) Exceptions.
Do not provide a different case name (i) when the parties’ names are merely reversed; (ii) when the citation in which the difference occurs is to a denial of certiorari or rehearing; (iii) when, in the appeal of an administrative action, the name of the private party remains the same; or (iv) when the change is simply stylistic (e.g., “
State
” to “
California
”):
United Dairy Farmers Coop. Ass'n, 194 NLRB 1094,
enforced
, 465 F.2d 1401 (3d Cir. 1972).
But:
Perma Vinyl Corp., 164 NLRB 968 (1967),
enforced sub nom.
, U.S. Pipe & Foundry Co. v. NLRB, 398 F.2d 544 (5th Cir. 1968).
