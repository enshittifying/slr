Special Citation Forms
(pp. 117–21)
10.8.1 –
Pending and Unreported Cases
(a) Cases available on electronic media.
When a case is unreported but available on a widely used electronic database, it may be cited to that database. Provide the case name, docket number, database identifier, court name, and full date of the most recent major disposition of the case. Cite to the case docket number of a case as it appears on court documents. However, an initial digit preceding a colon and a judge's initials at the end of the docket number may be omitted. Do not omit any other letters or numbers in the case docket number.
If the database contains codes or numbers that uniquely identify the case (as do LexisNexis, Westlaw, and Bloomberg Law), these must be given. Screen or page numbers, if the database assigns them, should be preceded by an asterisk; paragraph numbers, if assigned, should be preceded by a paragraph symbol:
Int'l Snowmobile Mfrs. Ass'n v. Norton, No. 00-CV-229-B, 2004 WL 2337372, at *3, *7 (D. Wyo. Oct. 14, 2004).
Shelton v. City of Manhattan Beach, No. B171606, 2004 WL 2163741, at *1 (Cal. Ct. App. Sep. 28, 2004).
Ortho-McNeil Pharm., Inc. v. Teva Pharm. Indus., Ltd., No. 2008-1549, 2009 BL 181480, at *4 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 26, 2009).
Gibbs v. Frank, No. 02-3924, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 21357, at *18–19 (3d Cir. Oct. 14, 2004).
Albrecht v. Stranczek, No. 87 C 9535, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5088, at *1, *3 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 15, 1991).
Note that in 2024 LexisNexis introduced an alternative short citation form that may be used interchangeably:
Albrecht v. Stranczek, No. 87 C 9535, 1991 LX 2672345, at *1, *3 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 15, 1991).
If the name of the database is not clear from the database identifier, include it parenthetically at the end of the citation:
Staats v. Brown, No. 65681-9, 2000 WA 0042007, ¶ 25 (Wash. Jan. 6, 2000) (VersusLaw).
Citations to cases that have not been assigned unique database identifiers should include all relevant information, such as the specific collection within the database in which the case can be found:
Frankel v. Banco Nacional de Mex., S.A., No. 82 Civ. 6547 (S.D.N.Y. May 31, 1983) (LEXIS, Genfed Library, Dist. File).
Lindquist v. Hart, 1 CA-CV 98-0323 (Ariz. Ct. App. July 15, 1999) (Loislaw, Ariz. Case Law).
(b) Cases available in slip opinions.
When a case is unreported but available in a separately printed slip opinion, give the docket number, the court, and the full date of the most recent major disposition of the case:
Groucho Marx Prods. v. Playboy Enters., No. 77 Civ. 1782 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 1977).
Note any renumbering of the docket:
United States v. Johnson, 425 F.2d 630 (9th Cir. 1970),
cert. granted
, 403 U.S. 956 (1971) (No. 577, 1970 Term; renumbered No. 70-8, 1971 Term).
Always give the full docket number:
No. 75-31
Not:
No. 31
If the date given does not refer to the date of decision and the significance of the date is not indicated elsewhere, indicate that significance within the parenthetical containing the date:
Ross v. Weissman, No. 90-345 (D. Mass. filed Sep. 18, 1990).
To cite a particular page of a separately paginated slip opinion, use the form:
Ross v. Weissman, No. 90-345, slip op. at 6 (D. Mass. Dec. 4, 1990).
If the case is not separately paginated, cite the page on which the case begins as well as the page on which any particular cited material appears:
Bedell v. Nessim, No. 90-567, slip op. 3458, 3465 (1st Cir. Jan. 19, 1991).
In pending or unreported adversary proceedings in bankruptcy, supply both the case number of the underlying nonadversary proceeding and the case number of the adversary proceeding:
Brown v. Sachs (
In re
Brown), Ch. 7 Case No. 84-00170-G, Adv. No. 85-1190, slip op. at 5 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 24, 1986).
(c) Other pending and unreported cases.
Cases that are not available in slip opinions or on electronic databases may be cited to services (
rule 19
), periodicals (
rule 16
), or the internet (
rule 18.2.2
).
(d) Depublished cases.
A number of jurisdictions allow their decisions to be “depublished,” usually when review is denied, and generally without a reported order. When there is no reported order depublishing the lower court decision, the fact that the case was depublished should be indicated parenthetically:
Mitchell v. Cal. Fair Plan Ass’n, 260 Cal. Rptr. 3 (Ct. App. 1989) (depublished).
If the order depublishing a case
is
reported, the order should be indicated as subsequent history pursuant to
rule 10.7
, introduced with the explanatory phrase “
depublished by
,
”.
10.8.2 –
Fifth Circuit Split
On October 1, 1981, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was divided to create the new Fifth and Eleventh Circuits. Cite cases decided during the transitional period leading to this reorganization according to the following rules: (i) cite decisions rendered in 1981 and labeled “
5th Cir.
” by month; (ii) give unit information whenever available; and (iii) designate as “
Former 5th Cir.
” any nonunit judgment labeled as a Former Fifth judgment and rendered after September 30, 1981:
Birl v. Estelle, 660 F.2d 592 (5th Cir. Nov. 1981).
Haitian Refugee Ctr. v. Smith, 676 F.2d 1023 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982).
Trailways, Inc. v. ICC, 676 F.2d 1019 (5th Cir. Unit A Aug. 1981) (per curiam).
McCormick v. United States, 680 F.2d 345 (Former 5th Cir. 1982).
10.8.3 –
Briefs, Court Filings, and Transcripts
Citation for a petitioner's brief in a U.S. Supreme Court case:
In general, all court filings follow the same general form. The full name of the document, as it appears on the filing, must come first, abbreviated according to
rule 10.2.1(c)
, followed by a pinpoint citation, if any. The full case citation and the docket number should follow the name of the document and the pinpoint citation. If no decision has yet been rendered in the case, the date in the parenthetical should be the date
on which the filing was made
. If a decision has been rendered, cite the case as you otherwise would:
Complaint at 17, Kelly v. Wyman, 294 F. Supp. 893 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (No. 68 Civ. 394).
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment at 2,
In re
3M Combat Arms Earplug Prods. Liab. Litig., No. 20-CV-47213 (N.D. Fla. July 7, 2022).
Always include the docket number, whether parenthetically (when there
is
a reported citation) or
as
the citation (when there is no reported citation):
Brief of Petitioner-Appellant at 48, United States v. Al-Marri, No. 03-3674 (7th Cir. Nov. 12, 2003).
The document number assigned by the court, such as that found on PACER for federal cases, may also be included, but is not necessary unless it is essential to finding the document:
Amended Complaint & Demand for Jury Trial, Viola v. Am. Brands, Inc., No. 85-2496-G (D. Mass. Aug. 1, 1985), Dkt. No. 14.
With court-produced documents, including oral argument transcripts and transcripts of record, the same general rules apply:
Transcript of Oral Argument at 11, Ayers v. Belmontes, 127 S. Ct. 469 (2006) (No. 05-493).
Transcript of Record at 16–17, Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763 (1950) (No. 306).
With amicus briefs, the same general rules apply, with the sole exception that if there are more than two signatories to the brief, “
et al
.” may be used:
Brief for Ringling Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. et al. as Amici Curiae Supporting Respondents, Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc., 537 U.S. 418 (2003) (No. 01-1015).
Further, though the above information is sufficient, a parallel citation to an electronic database or a website may be provided, if helpful:
Brief for Ringling Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. et al. as Amici Curiae Supporting Respondents, Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc., 537 U.S. 418 (2003) (No. 01-1015), 2002 WL 1987618.
Such parallel citations
must
include a pinpoint citation to the electronic database where one is required for the primary document, and vice versa.
With audio recordings of court proceedings, including oral arguments and oral dissents, the same general rules apply, except that the title may be a description of the recording. Time markers should be used for designating pinpoint citations. If the recording is available online, append a URL pursuant to
rule 18.8
:
Oral Argument at 11:38, Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) (No. 70-18),
http://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1971/1971_70_18/argument
.
Oral Dissent of Justice Ginsburg at 04:25, Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 127 S. Ct. 2162 (2007) (No. 05-1074),
http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2006/2006_05_1074/opinion
.
For purposes of short forms (
rule 10.9
), a citation to a court document including a case citation suffices as a citation to the case itself. Where the case may be cited in short form per
rule 10.9
, it may be cited in short form in the citation to the court document, but the docket number must still be provided:
1
Brief for the Petitioner, Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510 (2003) (No. 01-1491).
2
Petition for Writ of Certiorari,
Demore
, 538 U.S. 510 (No. 01-1491).
Further, the court document itself may be cited using a
supra
form, unlike the case, which may not. A
supra
form for the court document, however, does not count for purposes of the “five footnote rule" (
rule 10.9(a)
). The document title will suffice as a reference so long as it does not create confusion. Hereinafter forms may also be used (
rule 4.2(b)
), if helpful:
3
Brief for the Petitioner,
supra
note 1, at 12.
10.8.4 –
Court Administrative Orders
Cite the official reporter, if therein; give the title of the order, if any:
Order Discharging the Advisory Comm., 352 U.S. 803 (1956).
