Short Forms for Cases
(pp. 121–24)
(a) Footnotes.
In law review footnotes, a short form for a case may be used if it clearly identifies a case that (1) is already cited in the
same footnote
or (2) is cited (in either full or short form, including “
id.
”) in
one of the preceding five footnotes
. Otherwise, a full citation is required. Thus, in the following example, the use of the short form in footnotes 4 and 7–8 is correct:
1
United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531 (1985).
2
Id.
at 537–38.

See
United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 557 (1976); Cal. Bankers Ass’n v. Shultz, 416 U.S. 21, 62 (1974); Zimmermann v. Jenkins (
In re
GGM, P.C.), 165 F.3d 1026, 1027 (5th Cir. 1999); Cohen v. Drexel Burnham Lambert Grp. (
In re
Drexel Burnham Lambert Grp.), 138 B.R. 687, 702 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1992);
In re
Draughon Training Inst., Inc., 119 B.R. 921, 926 (Bankr. W.D. La. 1990).

(i) Generally.
Use of only one party’s name (or a readily identifiable shorter version of one party’s name) in a short form citation is permissible only if the reference is unambiguous. When only one party’s name (or a short form thereof) is used, it should be italicized. Acceptable short forms include:
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. at 585.
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.
, 343 U.S. at 585.
Youngstown
, 343 U.S. at 585.
343 U.S. at 585.
Id.
at 585.
Omit the case name as in the last two examples only if the reader will have no doubt about the case to which the citation refers.
Per
rule 10.2.1(k)
, a case may also be cited in short form by a different name than that which appears in the reporter, so long as the full citation includes both versions:
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (
The Steel Seizure Case
), 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952).
becomes:
The Steel Seizure Case
, 343 U.S. at 585.
When citing an entire decision, and not a pinpoint therein, in short form, the citation must include the shorter version of the case name, the volume number, reporter designation, and first page; but do
not
include a jurisdiction/date parenthetical:
The Steel Seizure Case
, 343 U.S. 579.
When using only one party's name in a short form citation, avoid using the name of a geographical or government unit, a government official, or another common litigant. Thus:
NAACP v. Alabama
ex rel.
Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 464 (1958).
becomes:
Patterson
, 357 U.S. at 464.
Not:
NAACP
, 357 U.S. at 464.
Not:
Alabama
, 357 U.S. at 464.
Reno v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 480 (1997).
becomes:
Bossier Parish Sch. Bd.
, 520 U.S. at 480.
Not:
Reno
, 520 U.S. at 480.
(ii) Commercial electronic databases.
For cases that are available on an electronic database (
rule 10.8.1(a)
), use a unique database identifier, if one has been assigned, in constructing a short form:
Clark v. Homrighous, No. CIV.A.90-1380-T, 1991 WL 55402, at *3 (D. Kan. Apr. 10, 1991).
becomes:
Clark
, 1991 WL 55402, at *3.
Albrecht v. Stanczek, No. 87-C9535, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5088, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 18, 1991).
becomes:
Albrecht
, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5088, at *1.
Lindquist v. Hart, 1 CA-CV 98-0323, at *2 (Ariz. Ct. App. July 15, 1999) (Loislaw, Ariz. Case Law).
becomes:
Lindquist
, at *2 (Loislaw, Ariz. Case Law).
(iii) Slip opinions.
For decisions available in only separately printed slip opinions (
rule 10.8.1(b)
), use the following format:
Commonwealth v. Sam, No. 4359, slip op. at 12 (Pa. Ct. Com. Pl. Oct. 20, 2005).
becomes:
Sam
, slip op. at 12.
When citing multiple slip opinions for the same case, either give each decision a unique identifier in its initial citation or include a jurisdiction or date parenthetical in each short form. The following short forms are thus both acceptable:
Doe v. Clenchy (
Clenchy II
), No. CV-09-201, slip op. at 4–6 (Me. Super. Ct. Nov. 20, 2012).
becomes:
Clenchy II
, slip op. at 5.
or:
Doe v. Clenchy, No. CV-09-201, slip op. at 4–6 (Me. Super. Ct. Nov. 20, 2012).
becomes:
Clenchy
, slip op. at 5 (Me. Super. Ct. Nov. 20, 2012).
(b) Two exceptions when using “
id.
”
There are two exceptions when using “
id.
” as a short form for case citations: (i) citation to the same case, but to a different opinion therein; and (ii) citation to the same case where the case citation includes parallel authorities.
(i) “
Id.
” for different opinions.
When an “
id.
” refers to the same case, and to the same opinion cited in the preceding citation, no parenthetical is necessary. But when an “
id.
” refers to a
different
opinion, that fact
must
be indicated parenthetically, even if the second opinion cited is the majority opinion. Thus, the following examples are all correct:
1
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (
The Steel Seizure
Case
), 343 U.S. 579 (1952).
2
Id
.
at 584.
3
Id
.
at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring).
4
Id
.
at 638.
5
Id
.
at 589 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).
6
Id
.
at 582 (majority opinion).
After an intervening citation to another source, the next time a case is cited, it is presumed to be citing to the majority opinion unless a parenthetical indicates otherwise.
(ii) “
Id.
” for parallel citations.
For cases in which a parallel citation is required, the “
id.
” form looks slightly different (to avoid confusion). Thus:
Chalfin v. Specter, 426 Pa. 464, 465, 233 A.2d 562, 563 (1967).
becomes:
Id
.
at 465, 233 A.2d at 563.
Not:
Id
.
at 465.
Not:
Id
.
at 465, 563.
(c) Text.
A case that has been cited in full in the same general discussion may be referred to (in main text or footnote text) by one of the parties’ names without further citation:
