Basic Citation Forms
(pp. 126–27)
Official and unofficial codes arrange statutes currently in force by subject matter. Official and privately published session laws report statutes in chronological order of enactment. Citing official codes is preferable, but not required. Cite secondary sources—such as looseleaf services, the CIS microform service, periodicals, newspapers, or electronic databases—only when the above listed sources are not available.
Rule 12.2
explains when to use each of these basic citation forms. The next four rules discuss the citation forms for official and unofficial codes (
rule 12.3
), session laws (
rule 12.4
), electronic media and online sources (
rule 12.5
), and other secondary sources (
rule 12.6
).
Rule 12.7
explains when the prior or subsequent history of a statute may or must be cited, and
rule 12.8
discusses the use of explanatory parenthetical phrases with respect to statute citations.
Rule 12.9
outlines special citation forms for the Internal Revenue Code, ordinances, rules of evidence and procedure, model codes, principles, restatements of law, standards, sentencing guidelines, uniform acts, and the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility.
Rule 12.10
provides short forms for statutes.
