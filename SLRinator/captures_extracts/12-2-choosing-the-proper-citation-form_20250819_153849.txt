12.2
Choosing the Proper Citation Form
(pp. 127–28)
12.2.1 –
General Rule
(a) Statutes currently in force.
If available, cite statutes currently in force to the current official code or its supplement. Otherwise, cite a current unofficial code or its supplement, the official session laws, privately published session laws (e.g.,
United States Code Congressional and Administrative News
), a commercial electronic database, a looseleaf service, an internet source, or a newspaper—in that order of preference:
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 § 102, 42 U.S.C. § 4332.
For example, a new main edition of the official
United States Code
is published every six years, and an annual cumulative supplement is published for each intervening year. An exact copy of the
United States Code
in PDF format may be found at
https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/uscode/
; these versions may be cited as if they were the print code. Codified federal statutes enacted subsequent to the latest edition or supplement of the Code should be cited to an unofficial code (e.g.,
West’s
United States Code Annotated
) until published in the
United States Code
.
(b) Statutes no longer in force.
Cite statutes no longer in force to the current official or unofficial code if they still appear therein. Otherwise, cite the last edition of the official or unofficial code in which the statute appeared, the session laws, or a secondary source—in that order of preference. In any case, the fact of invalidation, repeal, or amendment must be noted parenthetically according to
rule 12.7
:
Law of June 1, 1895, ch. 4322, § 23, 1895 Fla. Laws 3, 20–21 (repealed 1969).
Clayton Act, ch. 323, § 7, 38 Stat. 730, 731–32 (1914) (current version at 15 U.S.C. § 18).
(c) Private laws.
Cite private laws to the session laws if therein; otherwise, cite a secondary source:
Priv. L. No. 94-75, 90 Stat. 2985 (1976).
12.2.2 –
Exceptions
(a) Scattered statutes.
Cite the session laws if a statute appears in so many scattered sections or titles that no useful citation to the code is possible. Indicate parenthetically the general location of the codified sections. Thus:
Tax Reduction Act of 1975, Pub. L. No. 94-12, 89 Stat. 26 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 26 U.S.C.).
But:
Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 13–13b, 21a.
If the current version of a statute is split between the main body and the supplement of a code, it should be cited according to
rule 3.1(c)
:
42 U.S.C. § 1397b (1982 & Supp. I 1983).
If the current version of a statute can be determined only by reference to multiple sources (not just a code and its supplement), it should be cited according to
rule 12.7.3
:
31 U.S.C. § 3724 (1988),
amended by
, Act of Dec. 7, 1989, 31 U.S.C.S. § 3724 (Law. Co-op. Supp. 1990).
(b) Historical fact.
The historical fact of enactment, amendment, or repeal should be cited to the session laws. A parenthetical reference to the current version (see
rules 12.7
and
12.8
) may be added:
Two years later, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Pub. L. No. 89-110, 79 Stat. 445 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1971, 1973 to 1973bb-1).
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 increased criminal penalties for mail and wire fraud.
See
Pub. L. No. 107-204, § 903(a)–(b), 2002 U.S.C.C.A.N. (116 Stat.) 745, 805 (to be codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343).
(c) Materially different language.
If the language in the current code (including its supplement) differs materially from the language in the session laws and the relevant title has not been enacted into positive law, cite the session laws. A parenthetical reference to the code version, introduced by the phrase “
codified with some differences in language at
” may be given. If differences in the language merely reflect subsequent amendments, however, cite the current code.
Cite the official code if available. A current list of federal code titles that have been enacted into positive law appears in the preface to the latest edition or supplement of the
United States Code
. Similarly, state codes should indicate whether the titles contained therein have been enacted into positive law.
