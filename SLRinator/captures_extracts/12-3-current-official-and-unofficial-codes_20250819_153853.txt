12.3
Current Official and Unofficial Codes
(pp. 128–31)
Cite the
United States Code
(
U.S.C.
), the official federal code, if available. Unofficial federal codes include the
United States Code Annotated
(
U.S.C.A.
) and the
United States Code Service
(
U.S.C.S.
). Official and unofficial codes for each state (where they exist) are listed in
table T1.3
.
As with federal statutes, citing the official state codes is preferred, but not required.
All citations to codes should contain the abbreviated name of the code found in
table T1
printed in small capitals; the section, paragraph, or article number(s) of the statute; and the year of the code (determined according to
rule 12.3.2
):
N.C. Gen. Stat
. § 1-181 (2003).
12.3.1 –
Additional Information
Additional information may be required as follows:
(a) Name and original section number.
Give the statute’s name and original section number (as it appears in the appropriate session laws) only if the statute is commonly cited that way or if the information would otherwise aid in identification. Omit “
The
” as the first word of a statute’s name. Include the year of the statute if it is in the official title. An official name, a popular name, or both may be used:
Labor Management Relations (Taft-Hartley) Act § 301(a), 29 U.S.C. § 185(a).
Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993, 29 U.S.C. § 2601.
(b) Title, chapter, or volume.
If a code is divided into separately sectioned or paragraphed titles, chapters, or volumes, the title, chapter, or volume number must be indicated. When citing the federal code, give the title number before the name of the code:
42 U.S.C. § 1983.
12 U.S.C.S. § 1710 (LexisNexis 1993 & Supp. 2004).
The form for citation to state codes varies;
table T1.3
indicates whether and in what manner to identify the title, chapter, or volume number of a state code. For example:
Del. Code Ann
. tit. 13, § 1301 (1999).
Nev. Rev. Stat.
§ 28.501 (1998).
If each title, chapter, or volume of a code contains differently numbered sections or paragraphs, then the volume, chapter, or title number need not be given separately:
Ga. Code Ann
. § 21-2-16 (2003).
(c) Subject-matter codes.
If a separately sectioned or paragraphed portion of a code is identified by subject matter rather than by a title, volume, or chapter number, give that subject-matter name as part of the code:
Cal. Veh. Code
§ 11506 (West 2000).
Tex. Fam. Code Ann.
§ 5.01 (Vernon 2002 & Supp. 2004–2005).
Table T1.3
indicates which state codes require this treatment.
(d) Publisher, editor, or compiler.
Unless a code is published, edited, compiled by, or under the supervision of federal or state officials, give the name of the publisher, editor, or compiler in the parenthetical phrase containing the year of the code:
42 U.S.C.A. § 300a-7 (West 2001).
18 U.S.C.S. § 1307 (LexisNexis 1994 & Supp. 2004).
Cal. Veh. Code
§ 11509 (West 2000).
Not:
Cal. Veh. Code
§ 11509 (Cal. 2000).
Table T1
indicates which federal and state codes require this information.
(e) Supplements.
Cite material appearing in supplements (including pocket parts) according to
rule 3.1(c)
:
18 U.S.C. § 510(b) (Supp. I 1983).
12 U.S.C. § 1455 (1982 & Supp. I 1983).
(f) Compilations of uncodified laws.
If a code contains uncodified laws printed in a separate compilation, cite in this manner:
N.Y. Unconsol. Law
§ 751 (McKinney 2000).
(g) Appendices.
If a statute appears in an appendix to a code, and the statute is numbered and otherwise printed as if it were part of that code, cite according to
rule 3.4
:
50 U.S.C. app. § 5.
If the statute is not printed as if it were part of a code, cite the session laws and add an explanatory phrase (see
rule 1.6(a)(ii)
) indicating that the statute is reprinted in the code’s appendix:
Act of Aug. 31, 1970, ch. 842, 1970 Mass. Acts 732,
reprinted in
Mass. Gen. Laws Ann
. ch. 40 app. at 180 (West 1985).
(h) Notes.
If a statute appears in the notes section of a U.S. Code provision, cite according to
rule 3.4
. Information helpful in identifying a specific note should be added parenthetically:
12 U.S.C. § 1821 note (Continuation of Health Plan Coverage in Cases of Failed Financial Institutions).
12.3.2 –
Year of Code
Citations to the federal code, whether official or unofficial, do not require a date. When citing a bound volume of the current official or unofficial version of a state code or a federal code (where the date is desired), provide parenthetically the year that appears on the spine of the volume, the year that appears on the title page, or the latest copyright year—in that order of preference. If the date on the spine or title page spans more than one year, give all years covered. If the volume is a replacement of an earlier edition, use the year of the replacement volume, not the year of the original:
Neb. Rev. Stat.
§ 33-114 (1998).
When citing a provision that appears in a supplement or pocket part, give the year that appears on the title page of the supplement or pocket part. If there is none, give the latest copyright year of the supplement or pocket part. In either case, if the date spans more than one year, give all years included:
Ind. Code Ann.
§ 29-1-5-3.1 (West Supp. 2003).
To cite material that appears in both the main volume and a supplement or pocket part, give both years according to
rule 3.1(c)
:
Vt. Stat. Ann.
tit. 12, § 892 (2002 & Supp. 2004).
If a code is published in looseleaf form, give the year that appears on the page on which the provision is printed or the year that appears on the first page of the subdivision in which the provision appears—in that order of preference—rather than the years indicated above:
Alaska Stat.
§ 28.01.010 (2002).
Other dates (such as the date on which an act becomes effective) may also be given parenthetically according to
rule 12.8
:
Okla. Stat.
tit. 10, § 7303-1.7 (1998 & Supp. 2005) (effective July 1, 2002).
