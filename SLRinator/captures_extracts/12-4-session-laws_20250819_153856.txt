Session Laws
(pp. 131–32)
(a) Name.
When citing session laws, always give the name of the statute and the public law or chapter number. Omit “
The
” as the first word of a statute’s name. An official name, a popular name, or both may be used:
White-Slave Traffic (Mann) Act, ch. 395, 36 Stat. 825 (1910) (codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421–2424).
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, Pub. L. No. 87-195, 75 Stat. 424.
If the statute has no official or popular name, identify the act with a full date. Use the form “
Act of
<
date of enactment
>
,” or, if that information is unavailable, “
Act effective
<date of effectiveness>
.” Other identifying information may be added parenthetically:
Act of Aug. 21, 1974, ch. 85, 1974 N.J. Laws 385 (providing unemployment compensation for jurors).
Not:
An Act concerning unemployment compensation for persons serving on jury duty, and amending R.S. 43:21-4, ch. 85, 1974 N.J. Laws 385.
(b) Volume.
Give the volume number (or, if none, the year) of the session laws, followed by the abbreviated name of the session laws in ordinary roman type. The official federal session laws,
Statutes at Large
, are abbreviated “
Stat
.” Abbreviations for official and privately published state session laws appear in
tables T1.3
and
T1.4
. When citing state session laws, begin the abbreviated title of the session laws with the name of the state abbreviated according to
table T10
, even if the state name is not part of the official title; omit words in the official title not necessary for identification:
1978 Ark. Acts.
1935–1936 Ill. Laws 4th Spec. Sess.
1878 Minn. Laws.
Not:
1878 Laws of Minn.
(c) Pages and sections.
When citing an entire act, give the page of the session laws on which the act begins:
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970).
When citing only part of an act, give the section(s) or subsection(s) cited, the page on which the act begins, and the page(s) on which the relevant section(s) or subsection(s) appear(s):
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Pub. L. No. 91-190, § 102, 83 Stat. 852, 853–54 (1970).
Act of June 15, 1995, No. 302, § 3602(11), 1995 La. Sess. Law Serv. 344, 344 (West).
(d) Session laws amending prior acts.
Session laws amending prior acts are often divided into sections within sections; that is, the session law is divided into primary sections, and these sections, in turn, contain sections of the amended act. Cite the bill’s sections by abbreviation (
sec.
) and the amended act’s sections by symbol (
§
):
Labor-Management Relations Act, ch. 120, sec. 101, § 8(a)(3), 61 Stat. 136, 140–41 (1947).
(e) Year or date.
Give parenthetically the year in which the statute was passed by the legislature. If no date of enactment is identified, give the date on which the statute became effective:
McCarran-Ferguson Act, ch. 20, 59 Stat. 33 (1945) (codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. §§ 1011–1015).
Omit the year of the statute’s passage if the same year is part of the name of the statute or of the session laws:
Securities Act of 1933, ch. 38, 48 Stat. 74 (codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. §§ 77a–77aa).
Act of Apr. 25, 1978, No. 515, § 3, 1978 Ala. Acts 569, 569 (codified as amended at
Ala. Code
§ 9-3-12 (1987)).
(f) Codification information.
If a statute has been or will ultimately be codified, the code location is known, and the codification is relevant in the context of the citation, give that information parenthetically:
Act of July 12, 1985, ch. 223, § 3, 1985 Cal. Legis. Serv. 239, 241 (West) (to be codified at
Cal. Ins. Code
§ 11589.5).
Note that this rule is context dependent and permits codification information to be omitted if the statute is not being cited for its present application.
