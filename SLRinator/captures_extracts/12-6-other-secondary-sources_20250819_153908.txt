Other Secondary Sources
(pp. 133–34)
When citing a statute to any source other than a code, session laws, or an electronic database, give the name of the act and public law or chapter number as if citing to session laws (
rule 12.4
). When referring to a particular provision, give the section or subsection number after the public law or chapter number. If possible, cite federal statutes (particularly those enacted after 1974) to the
United States Code Congressional and Administrative News
, indicating the volume number (and page number, if known) of the
Statutes at Large
where the statute will appear (note that the page numbers in these two sources often differ):
Act of July 19, 1985, Pub. L. No. 99-68, 1985 U.S.C.C.A.N. (99 Stat.) 166.
Act of Aug. 13, 1954, ch. 731, 1954 U.S.C.C.A.N. (68 Stat. 717) 833.
When citing an entire act, give the page on which the act begins. When citing part of an act, give both the page on which the act begins and the pages on which the cited material appears. If the statute has been or will ultimately be codified and the code location is known, give that information parenthetically:
Act of July 9, 1985, Pub. L. No. 99-61, § 110, 1985 U.S.C.C.A.N. (99 Stat.) 113, 115 (to be codified at 31 U.S.C. § 5112).
Cite other secondary sources according to
rules 19
(services) or
16
(periodical materials) in that order of preference. Give the date or year appropriate for the cited source. If the name of a statute cited to a service includes the year, and the service was published in that year, the year of the service may be omitted. If the future location of the act in either a code or session laws is known, give that information parenthetically according to
rule 12.8
:
Presidential and Executive Office Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-331, [1 Lab. Rel.] Lab. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶ 660 (1997).
If a recent statute has not yet been published in any source, give only the name of the act; the public law or chapter number; the section or subsection number if referring to only part of the statute; the full date of enactment (or, if none, the date of approval by the executive or effective date); and the future location, if known, in a code or session laws:
Alabama Corporate Income Tax Reform Act, No. 85-515 (May 8, 1985).
