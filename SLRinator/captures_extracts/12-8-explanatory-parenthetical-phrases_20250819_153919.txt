Explanatory Parenthetical Phrases
(p.135)
Explanatory parenthetical phrases are used to show the code location of statutes cited to session laws (
rules 12.2.2
and
12.4
) or secondary sources (
rule 12.6
); to identify useful dates, such as the effective date of a statute (
rules 12.3.2
and
12.4(e)
); and to indicate the invalidation, repeal, amendment, or prior history (
rule 12.7
) of a statute. In addition, explanatory parenthetical phrases may be used to give any other relevant information about a statute:
5 U.S.C. § 553(b) (requiring agencies to publish notice of proposed rulemaking in the
Federal Register
).
See generally
rule 1.5
(parenthetical information).
