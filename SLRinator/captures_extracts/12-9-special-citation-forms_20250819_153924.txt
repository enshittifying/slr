Special Citation Forms
(pp. 135–39)
12.9.1 –
Internal Revenue Code
In citations to the Internal Revenue Code, “
26 U.S.C.
” may be replaced with “
I.R.C.
” Thus:
26 U.S.C. § 61.
becomes:
I.R.C. § 61.
Citations to the Internal Revenue Code as it appears in an unofficial code should identify the unofficial code by placing the publisher's name in the parenthetical phrase containing, if included, the year of the version cited. Thus, citations to U.S.C.A. should appear:
I.R.C. § 1371 (West Supp. 1991).
I.R.C. § 1247 (West).
