Short Citation Forms
(pp. 163–64)
Once a book, report, or other nonperiodic material has been cited in full in a law review footnote, a short form employing either “
id
.
” or “
supra
” may be used to refer to the work in subsequent citations. Never use “
infra
” to refer to these materials. In general, follow
rule 4
for short citation forms; however, use
rule 15.10.1
when referring to a shorter work in collection or the collection as a whole.
15.10.1 –
Short Forms for Works in Collection
To cite an essay, article, or document found within a volume of collected shorter works when the shorter work has already been cited in full, you may use “
id.
” to refer to the shorter work if it was cited as the immediately preceding authority within the same footnote or as the sole authority within the immediately preceding footnote. Do not use “
id.
” to refer to the collection as a whole when citing another shorter work within the collection.
Use a “
supra
” form to refer to the collection as a whole. The “
supra
” form for the entire volume should include the title of the collection (rather than an author) regardless of whether the collected pieces have a single author or multiple authors.
Use a “
supra
” form to refer to the shorter work if it was not cited as the immediately preceding authority in the same footnote or as the sole authority in the immediately preceding footnote. The “
supra
” form for the individual work should include the last name of the author or authors, or, if none, the title of the shorter work:
