Special Citation Forms
(pp. 170–74)
16.7.1 –
Student-Written Law Review Materials
(a) Signed, student-written materials.
Signed and titled notes, comments, projects, etc. are cited in the same manner as any other signed article in a law review (
rule 16.4
), with the author’s full name in ordinary roman type at the beginning of the citation (
rule 16.2
), except that the designation of the piece should appear before the title of the work (
rule 16.3
) to indicate that it is student-written. Cite student-written book reviews according to
rule 16.7.1(c)
.
A student work is considered signed if a student is credited with writing or contributing to the piece anywhere within the issue in which the work appears—on the first page of the piece, at the end of the piece, or in the table of contents. If a student work is signed only with initials, it is considered unsigned:

. Thus:
