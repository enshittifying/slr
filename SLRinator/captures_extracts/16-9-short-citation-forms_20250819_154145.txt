Short Citation Forms
(pp. 175–76)
Once a work in a periodical has been cited in full, use “
id
.
” or “
supra
” to refer to it in subsequent citations.
(a)
Id.
If the work cited is the same as the immediately preceding authority within the same footnote or as the sole authority within the immediately preceding footnote, use “
id
.
” and indicate any difference in page number:

(b)
Supra.
Include the author’s last name before “
supra
”; when there is no author, use the title of the piece, or, if listed before or instead of a title, the designation of the piece. However, if the first citation to the work gives a hereinafter form (
rule 4.2(b)
), use the hereinafter form in place of the author’s name, the title, or the designation. Give the footnote in which the full citation appears unless the full citation is in the same footnote, in which case “
supra
” may be used without a footnote reference. In using a “
supra
” form, always indicate the page or pages cited except when citing the work in its entirety:
