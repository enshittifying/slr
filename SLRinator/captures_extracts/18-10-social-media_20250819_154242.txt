Social Media Platforms
The mode of citation for content hosted on a social media platform depends on the nature of the underlying content being cited. Regardless of the type of content cited, the following rules should be followed:
The title of a post should be any text explicitly identified as a title. If there is no explicit title associated with the post, the content of a caption, the post itself, or, when the content cited is visual, a summary description of the visual elements of the post may be used, if doing so would aid in identifying the post or in establishing its relevance as a citation.
When the name of the poster of any content is unavailable, it may be substituted by the handle of the poster, and the parenthetical indicating the handle may be omitted. Handles should always be cited in the format used by the underlying platform. Cite the name of a platform as per its official name as it is presented at the time of citing.
(a) Visual and audio content.
Cite visual or audio-based content by the type of content, name of the poster (if available) and their handle in a parenthetical, the name of the platform and any relevant subdivision within a parenthetical, the title or caption of the post (if relevant), the date and time of posting to the extent of detail possible within a parenthetical, the URL, and a permanent location where the content will be stored:

Communication Services
The mode of citation for a communication service depends on the medium employed. All communications cited must be saved on file as a video recording, audio recording, image, or verifiable transcript.
(a) Audio and video communications.
Audio and video communications may be cited by the name of the participant whose statement is being cited (if applicable), the type of communication, the names of the participants, and the name of the platform, followed by a parenthetical indicating the date of the call, and a parenthetical indicating where a record of the communication may be found. When there are more than three participants, list the first three in alphabetical order by last name, and indicate the exclusions by et al. Time markers may be used for designating pinpoint citations, using the phrase “,
at XX:XX
” immediately after the name of participant that is being cited, but they are not required:
Statement by Cain Marko, video call between Victor Creed, Raven Darkholme & Erik Lehnsherr et al.,
Zoom
(Jan. 30, 2024) (on file with the author).
Statement by Reed Richards, audio call between Reed Richards & Viktor Vaughn, at 09:22,
FaceTime
(Mar. 10, 2024) (on file with the author).
(b) Text communications.
Peer-to-peer text communications, i.e., communications between two individuals, may be cited by the name of the author, the name of the recipient, and the name of the communication service, followed by a parenthetical indicating the date and time when the communication was sent, and a parenthetical indicating where a record of the communication may be found:

Group text communications, i.e., communications from an individual to a larger group, may be cited similarly to peer-to-peer text communications, by replacing the name of the recipient with the name of the group, followed by a parenthetical indicating the names of up to three other members of the group who were in receipt of the communication. When more than three other members in the group receive the communication, this may be indicated by “et al.,”  and the three named should be in alphabetical order by last name, excluding the sender:
Message from Otto Octavius to the Sinister Six (group consisting of William Baker, Maxwell Dillon & Sergei Nikolaevich Kravinoff et al.),
