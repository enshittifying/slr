18.2
The Internet
(pp. 185–90)
The Bluebook
requires the use and citation of traditional printed sources when available, unless there is a digital copy of the source available that is authenticated, official, or an exact copy of the printed source, as described in
rule 18.2.1
.
The rules that follow offer guidance in formatting citations to webpages and other internet sources not addressed elsewhere in rule 18, collectively referred to as web-based sources.
Rule 18.2.1
lays out general principles applicable to these citations.
Rule 18.2.2
sets out rules for direct citations to web-based internet sources.
18.2.1 –
General Internet Citation Principles
(a) Sources that can be cited as if to the original print source.
When an authenticated, official, or exact copy of a source is available online, citation can be made as if to the original print source (without any URL information appended).
(i) Authenticated documents.
When citing web-based documents,
The Bluebook
encourages citation to “authenticated” sources: those that use an encryption-based authentication method, such as a digital signature or public key infrastructure, to ensure the accuracy of the online source. Generally, an authenticated document will have a certificate or logo indicating that a government entity verified that the document is complete and unaltered.
(ii) Official versions.
Generally,
The Bluebook
prefers citation to an authenticated source, or, if no authenticated source is available, to a source as proximate to the original as possible. Documents designated as official are considered, for citation purposes, to be proximate to the original. Some states have designated, either by legislation or other official mechanism, that the online source is the “official” source for a particular legal document. Documents published on government websites and authored by government entities are to be considered official versions. Similarly, some online publishers make a distinction as to whether the document has been approved by, contributed by, or harvested from an official source by the content originator, designating such a document “official.”
(iii) Exact copies.
An exact copy is one that is an unaltered copy of the printed source in a widely used format that preserves pagination and other attributes of the printed work (such as a PDF). An exact copy is treated similarly to an official version.
(b) Sources where the URL should be appended.
(i) Obscure sources.
If the cited information is available in a traditional source but such source is so obscure as to be practically unavailable, or if a parallel citation to an internet source will substantially improve access to the source cited, the citation should be made both to the traditional source and to the internet source by appending the URL directly to the end of the citation and providing for archival preservation of the source under
rule 18.2.1(d)
.
(ii) Web-based sources with print characteristics.
If a web-based source shares the characteristics of a print source such that it could be fully cited according to another rule in
The Bluebook
, the citation should be made as if to the print source and the URL appended directly to the end of the citation, even if it is unknown whether the cited information is available in print:

https://ssrn.com/abstract=4730878
[
https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4730878
].
To share the characteristics of a print source, an online source must be a version permanently divided into pages with permanent page numbers, as in a PDF, and have the elements that characterize a given print source, such as a volume number (for law review articles and the like) or publication date (for magazine articles and the like).
If an online source can be formatted in full compliance with another rule in
The Bluebook
, for purposes of citation style it does not matter whether that source has in fact been published in print. As noted above, traditional printed sources or authenticated digital copies are required as a matter of authority; this does not, however, affect the citation rules for print-like online sources.
(c) Order of parentheticals.
When such a citation requires multiple parentheticals, place them in the order indicated in
rule 1.5(b)
.  Thus, the URL of a source cited in accordance with
rule 18.2.1(b)
should follow format-related parenthetical information (such as “
alteration in original
,” “
unpublished manuscript
,” or “
emphasis added
”) and related authority parentheticals (such as “
citing
” or “
quoting
”), but precede explanatory parentheticals:

[
https://perma.cc/7XGW-ZGML
] (noting that taxes on wages fund social security).
(d) Archival.
The Bluebook
requires that all online content cited or generated by authors be captured and stored in a permanent setting. Due to increased algorithmic individuation of internet-browsing experiences, internet-based sources, such as a search engine’s query results, may produce dramatically different results across different periods of time. Archiving can be achieved by using a reliable archival tool, or by saving the web-based source in a fixed form such as a PDF, and storing the saved version on file.
When using an archival tool, append the archive URL to the full citation in brackets:

[
https://perma.cc/PT32-56LR
].
When archiving the source by saving a version on file, indicate where the saved source may be found in a parenthetical following the URL:

18.2.2 –
Citations to Web-Based Sources
A web-based source that cannot be cited according to another rule in
The Bluebook
as stated in accordance with
rule 18.2.1(b)(ii)
, should be cited as if to the original print source in accordance with rule
18.2.1(a)
or according to this rule. All efforts should be made to cite to the most stable electronic location available. The web-based source citation should include information designed to facilitate the clearest path of access to the cited reference, including the title, pagination, and publication date as they appear on the webpage. The internet URL should be separated by a comma and appended to the end of the citation. Archival preservation should also be provided for in accordance with
rule 18.2.1(d)
.
(a) Author of relevant object.
When available, provide author information in ordinary roman type. When no author is clearly announced, omit author information from the citation unless there is a clear institutional owner of the domain. Abbreviate the name of an institutional author according to
rule 15.1(e)
:

(b) Webpage or web-object titles.
Titles should be used to indicate the location of the page being viewed in relation to the rest of the site. Titles should be taken either from the “title bar” at the top of the browser or from any clearly announced heading identifying the page as it appears in the browser. All efforts should be made to include a title that sufficiently identifies the page but that is not unwieldy, long, uninformative, or confusing:

(i) Main page titles.
The citation should always include the homepage or domain name of which the particular citation is a part, referred to here as a “main page title.” The website’s main page title should be cited using small capitals. Capitalization should conform to the title as it appears on the site. Main page titles should be abbreviated in accordance with
tables T6
,
T10
, and
T13

(ii) Titles for subdivisions contained within a larger web-based source.
If the cited source is published under the name of a blog or other subdivision that has its own content and presence within a larger web-based source, both the name of the site and the name of the subdivision should be included. Titles for subdivisions should be preceded by a colon. Follow standard rules for capitalizing the titles of sources in accordance with
rule 8
, even if the title bar uses nonstandard capitalization. Where appropriate, subheadings should include language indicating the page’s relation to the page to which it responds:

] (last visited Jan. 28, 2024).
(c) Date and time.
The date should be provided as it appears on the internet site. Use only dates that refer clearly to the material cited. The date should be indicated after the main page title and any pinpoint citation:

https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/dining/ai-restaurant-reviews.html
(on file with the Yale Law Journal).
When material is otherwise undated, the date that the website was last visited should be placed in a parenthetical after the URL:
Yahoo!
,
http://www.yahoo.com
[
https://perma.cc/94S2-LKJW
] (last visited Aug. 12, 2024).
If an archival tool that indicates when a source was archived is utilized, indicate the date of archival as the date in the “
last visited
” parenthetical after the URL.
It is recommended that citations for web-based sources include a timestamp whenever possible. Timestamps should be provided in twenty-four-hour clock formatting with a time zone designation following the timestamp. The time zone designation is determined by the time zone provided by the source. If no time zone designation is provided by the source, use the time zone of the device accessing the source. When the time zone provided is a subdivision of a larger time zone differentiated due to the observance of daylight savings, use the larger time zone designation:

https://balkin.blogspot.com/2024/05/reading-tea-leaves-on-marijuana.html
[
https://perma.cc/AN4W-RX42
].
Timestamps are especially encouraged when the citation is for a comment to a posting or is otherwise easily identifiable by the time of its posting.
(d) The URL.
A site’s internet address, or URL, should point readers directly to the source cited rather than to an intervening page of links. If there is a shortlink available that clearly indicates the source of the site (e.g.,
wapo.st
,
imdb.to
, but not
bit.ly
), then cite the shortlink. If no shortlink is available, but the full URL is straightforward, then cite the entire URL as it appears in the address bar of the browser:
Stanley Kubrick Biography
, IMDB,

Not:
Stanley Kubrick Biography
, IMDB,
http://imdb.com
(search in search bar for "Stanley Kubrick"; then follow "Biography" hyperlink under "Quick Links") (last visited July 22, 2024).
Alternatively, the root URL of the site from which information is accessed may be used if (1) the URL is long, unwieldy, or full of nontextual characters (such as question marks, percentage signs, or ampersands); or (2) the source can only be obtained only by submitting a form or query. If the root URL is used and the site’s format is not clear from the rest of the citation, a clarifying parenthetical should be added to explain how to access the specific information to which the citation refers:
http://fjsrc.urban.org/noframe/wqs/q_data_1.htm#2001
(choose “2001" from dropdown; then choose "Defendants in Criminal Cases-Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC)"; then click "out" and "submit"; then follow "TTSECMO" hyperlink).
Not:
http://fjsrc.urban.org/noframe/wqs/q_e.cfm?cat=3&year=2001&agency=AOUSC&saf=out&var1=TTSECMSO
.
Note that some URLs are case sensitive, so cite URLs as they appear in the internet browser.
(e) Multiple URLs.
Some popular sites are served by more than one URL. In these cases, a proper citation should use the primary URL rather than a URL that links to an alternate server:
Macy's
, http://www.macys.com [https://perma.cc/S2LQ-CSYS] (last visited July 23, 2024).
Not:
Macy's
, http://www1.macys.com (last visited July 23, 2024).
(f) Document format.
When a document is available both in a format that preserves pagination and other attributes of a printed work (such as PDF) and one that does not, the former should always be cited:
Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau
,

,
https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_sbl_sample-data-collection-form.pdf

] (last visited July 23, 2024).
(g) Pinpoint citations.
If the cited document is rendered in a format that preserves the pagination of a print version (such as a PDF file), pinpoint citations should be provided when appropriate. Page numbers should always refer to the numbers that appear on the document itself. Do not use “screen numbers” or other numbers that may appear in a software-viewing window or scroll bar. When there is pagination information available, it should be included between the domain name and the date or URL, whichever comes first.
