CONTENT:
18.3
AI-Generated Content
(p.191)
(a) Large language models.
The Bluebook
requires that authors citing outputs from generative artificial intelligence services, e.g., ChatGPT conversations or Google search results, save a screenshot capture of that output as a PDF to be stored on file. The tailored nature of deep neural networks individualizes the internet such that a URL will no longer suffice for an increasing number of web-based resources.
The prompted responses of large language models such as ChatGPT and CoPilot should be cited by the author of the prompt, the name of the model used (including version number if the model is identified according to version), the exact text of the prompt submission in quotation marks, the date when the prompt was submitted, and a parenthetical indicating where the PDF is stored:
Luke Cronin, Google Gemini Advanced, “Who would make a better Supreme Court Justice: Beyoncé or Taylor Swift?” (Mar. 29, 2024) (on file with the Columbia Law Review).
Not:
Luke Cronin, Gemini Advanced, "Who would make a better Supreme Court Justice: Beyoncé or Taylor Swift?" (Mar. 29, 2024),

.
(b) Search results.
The results of search engine inquiries may be cited by the name of the search engine in small capitals, the exact text of the query (including any boolean operators employed) in quotation marks, the number of results (if available), the date when the search was conducted, and a parenthetical indicating where the PDF is stored. When content filters are employed to narrow results, use the number of results present after the filter is applied, and indicate in a parenthetical what filters were employed; when multiple subsequent filters are employed, indicate each in the same parenthetical, separated by commas. For the purposes of this rule, commas that were not part of the search query should be kept outside quotation marks:
Bing
, “The Bluebook”, 6,050,000 results (May 22, 2024) (on file with the Harvard Law Review).
Westlaw
, +“Disclosure Controls” +“SEC”, 1 result  (Mar. 30, 2024) (on file with the Yale Law Journal) (filtered by “Cases”, “2d Cir.”).
(c) AI-generated content.
Content that has been generated by AI should be cited according to the relevant
Bluebook
subrule, with the addition of a parenthetical indicating that the content has been generated by AI, and the AI model used to generate the content. When the relevant subrule requires the name of an author, substitute the author name with the name of the individual who submitted the prompt to the AI, if available, or omit the author name when unavailable:
