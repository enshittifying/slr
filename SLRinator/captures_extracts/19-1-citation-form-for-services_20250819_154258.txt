Citation Form for Services
(pp. 205–06)
Cite services by volume, abbreviated title in ordinary roman type, publisher, subdivision, and date. If the source is a case, include the abbreviated name of the court in the same parenthetical as the date, as you would under
rule 10.4
. Consult
table T15
for service and publisher abbreviations; if a service is not listed, refer to
table T6
to abbreviate the words that make up its title:
In re
Smithfield Ests., Inc., [1985–1986 Transfer Binder] Bankr. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶ 70,707 (Bankr. D.R.I. Aug. 9, 1985).
SEC v. Tex. Int’l Airlines, 29 Fed. R. Serv. 2d (West) 408 (D.D.C. 1979).
Kovacs v. Comm’r, 74 A.F.T.R.2d (RIA) 354 (6th Cir. 1994).
When citing looseleaf material that will eventually be bound, add the name of the bound form in parentheses if it is different from the name of the looseleaf form; include the volume of the bound form if available:
Marietta Concrete Co., 3 Lab. Rel. Rep. (BL) (84
Lab. Arb. Rep.
(BL)) 1158 (May 7, 1985).
When citing to services found on a commercial electronic database, provide a parallel citation to the database, including the database identifier and any codes or numbers that identify the information:
Dynda Thomas,
Conflict Minerals – You Have More to Worry About than Just the SEC
, 38 Chem. Reg. Rep. (BL) 186, 38 CRR 186 (BL) (Feb. 10, 2014).
(a) Volume.
The volume designation of a service may be a number, a year, a descriptive subtitle from the volume’s spine, or a combination of these.  If the volume designation includes words or a year, use brackets to avoid confusion:
5 Trade Reg. Rep.
1979-1 Trade Cas.
[Current Developments] Hous. & Dev. Rep.
[1979] 8 Stand. Fed. Tax Rep.
[2 Wages-Hours] Lab. L. Rep.
[1 Estate & Gift] U.S. Tax Rep.
In citing a transfer binder, the volume designation should indicate the years of material included in that binder:
[1994–1995 Transfer Binder] Fed. Sec. L. Rep.
See generally
rule 3.1(a)
(designation of volumes and use of brackets).
(b) Publisher.
Every citation to a service, whether looseleaf or bound, must indicate the publisher. Enclose an abbreviation of the publisher’s name in parentheses following the service’s title. Consult
table T15
for a list of service publisher abbreviations; if a publisher is not listed, abbreviate according to
rule 15.1(e)
:
4 Lab. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶ 9046.
[1982] 12 Envtl. L. Rep. (Envtl. Law Inst.).
(c) Subdivision.
Cite services by paragraph or section number if possible, otherwise by page number. See generally
rule 3.2
(pages, footnotes, endnotes, and graphical materials) and
rule 3.3
(sections and paragraphs). Additionally, a report number may be given if it will assist the reader in locating the cited material:

(d) Date.
When citing a case reported in a service, give the exact date (for looseleaf services) or year (for bound services) of the case (
rule 10.5
):

When citing a statute or regulation, give the exact date of its enactment or promulgation unless the exact date is indicated elsewhere in the citation:
Act of Sep. 26, 1980, Food Drug Cosm. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶ 653.
Citations to other material (such as articles or commentary) should give the exact date, if available. When citing otherwise undated material in a looseleaf service, give the date of the page on which the material is printed or the date of the subsection in which it is printed:
