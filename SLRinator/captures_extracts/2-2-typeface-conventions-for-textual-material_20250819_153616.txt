Typeface Conventions for Textual Material
(pp. 74–76)
(a) Main text.
The main text of law review pieces does not contain citations and uses only ordinary roman type and italics. Most material appears in ordinary roman type. Only the following are italicized:
(i) Case names.
Italicize case names, including the “
v.
” and all procedural phrases such as “
In re
” and “
ex rel.
”:
Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada
(ii) Titles of publications, speeches, or articles.
Thus:
The library has a copy of
The Path of the Law
, which was published in the
Harvard Law Review
; a complete set of the
Federal Supplement
; and today’s
Wall Street Journal
. It does not have a copy of
Hearings on S. 776
or
Alaska Statutes
.
(iii) Style.
Italicize words for emphasis or other stylistic purposes (
rule 7
).  Also italicize words that are emphasized in quoted matter (
rule 5.2(d)
).
(b) Footnote text.
Unlike in the main text, a sentence in footnote text may contain citations, which are placed in citation clauses embedded in the sentence (
rule 1.1(b)
).
(i) Case names.
When a case name is grammatically part of the sentence in which it appears, it should be italicized:
In
Loving v. Virginia
, the Court invalidated Virginia’s antimiscegenation statute.
In
Loving v. Virginia
, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), the Court invalidated Virginia’s antimiscegenation statute.
When the case name is not grammatically part of the sentence, but rather used in a citation clause embedded in the footnote text, use the typeface conventions for citations (
rule 2.1(a)
):
The Court has upheld race-specific statutes that disadvantage a racial minority,
e.g.
, Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), but those decisions have been severely criticized.
Justice Harlan quipped that "one man's vulgarity is another's lyric,"
Cohen
, 403 U.S. at 25, but failed to provide further explanation.
(ii) All other authorities.
When referring to any other type of authority, whether or not the reference is grammatically part of the sentence, use the typeface conventions for citations if the full citation or a short form citation (
rule 4
) is given:
A different view is expressed in
Learned Hand, The Bill of Rights
(1958), and
Holmes
,
supra
note 2.
If the reference appears without the full or shortened citation information, follow the typeface conventions for the main text of law reviews (
rule 2.2(a)(ii)
):
Judge Hand explained his philosophy of judicial review in
The Bill of Rights
.
(iii) Explanatory parentheticals.
In explanatory parentheticals, follow the typeface convention for case names in citation text when a full citation clause is included:
Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 110 (2002) (citing Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984)).
Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 110 (2002) (addressing an argument based upon Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984)).
Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 110 (2002) (addressing an argument based upon
Chevron
).
(c) Punctuation.
Italicize commas, semicolons, etc., only when they constitute part of italicized material, and not when they are merely an element of the citation or sentence in which they appear. For purposes of clarity, the italicized punctuation marks in the examples below appear in blue:
When it decided
Sabine Towing
, the Fifth Circuit presented a somewhat different rationale for its holding.
Brannon Denning’s article,
Reforming the New Confirmation Process: Replacing “Despise and Resent” with “Advise and Consent
,
”
suggests amendments to the Senate’s procedural rules.
Not:

Reforming the New Confirmation Process: Replacing “Despise and Resent” with “Advise and Consent,”
suggests amendments to the Senate’s procedural rules.
(d) Omissions and Alterations
(
rules 5.2
and
5.3
).
Always romanize ellipses (. . .) or brackets ( [] ) when making alterations to quoted materials, even when the quoted materials are italicized, underlined, or bolded.
