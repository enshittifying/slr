Other Punctuation Conventions
(p.76)
Use only one space after punctuation for all standard proportional fonts. Only double space after monospaced fonts (e.g., Courier, Menlo, and Consolas).
Double spacing after periods is a relic of the period in which all typewriter fonts were monospaced. Modern word processing automatically makes such adjustments, and thus double spacing proportional fonts will result in formatting errors.
