Typography for Law Reviews
(p.72)
Legal writing uses four typefaces, though choice of font may vary (e.g., Times New Roman,
Courier
, etc.):
Ordinary Roman (Plain Text)
U
nderlined
Italicized
Small Capitals
Law reviews use two sets of typeface conventions—one for law review text (either main text or footnote text) (
rule 2.2
) and one for law review citations (
rule 2.1
). Unless otherwise noted, the examples in
The Bluebook
correspond to the convention for law review footnotes.
For an explanation of the typeface conventions commonly used in other forms of legal writing, see
Bluepages B2
. Practitioners can make ready use of the examples in
The Bluebook
by substituting the typeface conventions outlined in the
Bluepages
for those found in the examples throughout the rest of the book.
For example, a practitioner’s brief might look like this:
Directors manage the business and affairs of a corporation.
See
Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc.
, 506 A.2d 173, 179 (Del. 1986);
see also
Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 141(a) (2000). In
Guth v. Loft
, the court held that directors also owe a duty of loyalty to the shareholders. 5 A.2d 503, 510 (Del. 1939) (holding that directors‘ duty of loyalty demands that “there shall be no conflict between duty and self-interest”).
A similar section of a law review article might read:
