Statutes
(p.211)
20.5.1 –
Statutes in Common Law Systems
Cite like U.S. statutes (
rule 12
) if the jurisdiction’s statutes appear in a codification or other compilation:
Extradition Law, 5714–1954, LSI * 144 (1953–1954) (Isr.).
Otherwise, cite like statutes of the United Kingdom (
table T2.46
), noting the jurisdiction parenthetically at the end of the citation:
Emergency Powers Act, 1976 (Act No. 3/1976) (Ir.).
20.5.2 –
Statutes in Civil Law and Other Non-Common Law Jurisdictions
Cite generally according to rules found in
table T2
. When citing a code, do not indicate the year of the code unless citing a version no longer in force. In accordance with
rule 20.2.3
, use the full publication name the first time the publication is cited, indicating in brackets the abbreviation that will be used subsequently. Thereafter, the abbreviated form may be used:
Code civil [C. civ.] [Civil Code]
art. 1112 (Fr.).
Give the publisher or editor and date of privately published sources only when citing an annotation rather than the code itself:
Code civil [C. civ.] [Civil Code]
art. 1098 (64th ed. Petits Codes Dalloz 1965) (Fr.).
