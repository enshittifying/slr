Citations to digests should be avoided whenever a more official source is available.

Since 1973, the United States Department of State has published an annual

. Provide the title for the subsection, the year, the title of the digest, the chapter and subsection number, and a pincite if available:
U.N. Plan for Namibian Independence, 1989–90
Digest of United States Practice in International Law
, ch. 7, §A(1) at 198.
(b) Named digests.
Early digests were multi-volume sets edited by a single editor and known by that editor’s name. For these digests, provide the title of the section (including subtitles, if relevant, as under
rule 15.3
), the volume cited, the editor’s name followed by the word “
Digest
,” and the chapter and section number as appropriate, if any:

Whiteman Digest
, ch. 23, § 7, at 408.
(c) Foreign digests.
When citing digests of another country, cite analogously to those published in the United States. If the digest is published as an annual series, cite according to
rule 21.16(a)
. If the digest is identified by its editor’s name, cite according to
rule 21.16(b)
. The first time a foreign digest is cited, always provide the full title, followed by the abbreviation in brackets if useful for subsequent citations, similar to
rule 20.2.3
.
(d) Digests published as periodical sections.
When a digest appears as an annual or periodical section of a journal, cite the digest as an article under
rule 16
. Otherwise, cite the particular section in question as included in a larger work:
