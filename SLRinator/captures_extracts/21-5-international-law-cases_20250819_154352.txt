21.5.2 –
European Union Courts
Cite a case before the Court of Justice of the European Union (formerly the Court of Justice of the European Communities) or the General Court (formerly the Court of First Instance) by case number; the names of the parties, abbreviated according to
rule 10.2
and
table T6
; and the official reports of the Court, including the year of decision (
rule 21.5.2(a)
). A parallel citation to a private service may be made, if necessary (
rule 21.5.2(b)
).
For cases lodged before the Court of Justice since 1989, the case number will contain the prefix “
C
”; older cases will not have a prefix. Cases lodged before the General Court, created in 1989, will carry the prefix “
T
,” and the Civil Service Tribunal will carry the prefix "
F
." Where the Commission, Council, or Parliament of the European Union is one of the parties, give its name as “
Commission,” “Council
,” or “
Parliament
,” respectively:
Case T-198/98, Micro Leader Bus. v. Comm’n, 1999 E.C.R. II-3989.
Case C-213/89, The Queen v. Sec’y of State for Transp. (
Factortame Ltd.
), 1990 E.C.R. I-2433.
Case 58/69, Elz v. Comm’n, 1970 E.C.R. 507.
Cases on European Union law are often decided in the courts of member states. These cases should be cited to the reporters of the particular member state. If necessary, such cases may also be cited to one of the unofficial reporters collecting materials regarding the European Union (see
rule 21.5.8
). When citing such a case to European Union materials, indicate the court and jurisdiction if not clear from the context, as provided by
rule 20.1
.
(a) Official reports.
For pre-1990 cases, cite the
Reports of Cases Before the Court of Justice of the European Communities
(
E.C.R.
). For cases between 1990 and 2011, cite the
Reports of Cases Before the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance
(also abbreviated
E.C.R.
). Place the year designation before the reporter abbreviation. Starting in 1990, page numbers in the E.C.R. begin with a “
I,” “II,
” or “
III
”:
Case C-286/01, Comm’n v. France, 2002 E.C.R. I-5463.
Case 30/79, Land Berlin v. Wigei, 1980 E.C.R. 151.
Joined Cases 56 & 58/64, Établissements Consten, S.A.R.L. v. Comm’n, 1966 E.C.R. 299.
The E.C.R. was discontinued after 2011.
Starting in 2012, use the European Case-Law Identifier (
ECLI
) to cite to EU Court cases. All decided EU cases will have a generated ECLI. The format has four components, in addition to the prefix “
ECLI
”:
“
EU
” indicates a decision delivered by one of the Courts of the European Union; an abbreviation corresponding to the court or tribunal that delivered the decision: “
C
” indicates the Court of Justice, “
T
” indicates the General Court, and “
F
” indicates the Civil Service Tribunal; the year of the decision; an ordinal number indicating that the decision is the nth ECLI assigned that year.
Post-2011, EU Court citations should include: (1) the case number; (2) the parties’ names; (3) the ECLI, if available; (4) a pincite (using paragraph numbers, if available, rather than page numbers); and (5) the date:
Case C-434/16, Nowak v. Data Prot. Comm’r, ECLI:EU:C:2014:994, ¶¶ 54—55 (Dec. 20, 2017).
For pre-2011 official reports not available in print, cite to Curia, the official website of the Court of Justice of the European Union (
http://curia.europa.eu
) (
rule 18.2
), an electronic database (
rule 18.4
), or a private service (
rule 21.5.2(b)
). Citations to Curia should include: (1) the case number; (2) the parties’ names; (3) a pincite (using paragraph numbers, if available, rather than page numbers); (4) the date; and (5) the website URL:

https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=70502&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=2832097
(on file with author).

http://curia.europa.eu/juris/showPdf.jsf?docid=43541&doclang=EN
(on file with the Columbia Law Review).
(b) Private services.
If necessary, provide a parallel citation to one of the private services providing selected reports of the court’s opinions.
Common Market Law Reports
(
C.M.L.R.
) is preferred. When citing volumes through 1973, include the full volume number; when citing volumes 1974 and later, include the issue number to reflect cessation of continuous issue numbering. Otherwise, use
Common Market Reporter
(
Common Mkt. Rep. (CCH)
) (through 1988) or
European Community Cases
(
CEC (CCH)
). See
rule 19
for treatment of CCH looseleaf services:

Recent volumes are numbered by year of publication and do not require a separate reference to the year. Older decisions may also be cited to
Publications of the European Court of Human Rights
, which was issued in multiple series (e.g.,
Eur. Ct. H.R. (ser. A)
) or
Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights
(
Y.B. Eur. Conv. on H.R.

rule 10.2
); volume number; reporter; page number, where applicable; and year.
Recent volumes contain several cases, but some earlier volumes contain only one case. Where a volume contains only one case, citing a beginning page is unnecessary, and all page numbers may be indicated directly by “
at
”:
Ireland v. United Kingdom, 23 Eur. Ct. H.R. (ser. B) at 23 (1976).
Until 1999, cases were also heard before the now-defunct European Commission on Human Rights. These cases should be cited to
Collections of Decisions of the European Commission on Human Rights
(
Eur. Comm’n H.R. Dec. & Rep.
) or
Y.B. Eur. Conv. on H.R.
, if therein. If not, cite
European Human Rights Reports
(
Eur. H.R. Rep.
). When citing
Y.B. Eur. Conv. on H.R.
, indicate parenthetically whether the case was before the Commission or the Court. Indicate both the parties and the application number for the case:
Y. v. Netherlands, App. No. 7245/32, 32 Eur. Comm’n H.R. Dec. & Rep. 345, 358 (1982).
