United Nations Sources
(pp. 229–35)
The Official Records are the preferred source for United Nations citations, but masthead documents and documents drawn from U.N. websites are acceptable. Press releases, sales documents, yearbooks, and periodicals should be cited only when preferred sources are unavailable.
Whenever possible, paragraph and article numbers, rather than page numbers of the Official Records, should be used for pincites. Some documents utilize both unnumbered and numbered paragraphs, referred to as preambular and operative paragraphs, respectively; cite language in preambular paragraphs by page number and language in operative paragraphs by paragraph number. For General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, cite the Official Records and provide a parallel citation for the individual resolution.
This section covers the principal organs of the United Nations and several subsidiaries of the General Assembly. Subsidiaries of organs or committees should be included in citations whenever appropriate. Other organs and committees not specifically covered by this section should be cited analogously to the examples in this rule. If a committee is known by an abbreviation, write out the committee’s full name and include an abbreviation in brackets if useful for subsequent citations.
21.7.1 –
Verbatim and Summary Records
The General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Economic and Social Council have Official Records. All citations to verbatim and summary records should be to the Official Records whenever possible.
Include the Official Records title; the subdivision of the organ, if necessary; the session and meeting number; the pincite, if necessary; the U.N. document symbol; and the date:
U.N. GAOR, 56th Sess., 1st plen. mtg. at 3, U.N. Doc. A/56/PV.1 (Sep. 12, 2001).

21.7.2 –
Resolutions and Decisions
Authorized versions of resolutions appear in the Official Records. It has become customary, however, to cite electronic versions or resolutions found in the Official Document System (
ODS
) of the United Nations using resolution symbols. For pincites to material within a resolution, use paragraph or article numbers.
(a) General Assembly.
After 1976, General Assembly resolution symbols are designated as session number/resolution number. The first resolution adopted during the forty-seventh General Assembly would thus be
G.A. Res. 47/1
.
Prior to 1976, the resolution symbols continued increasing from year to year and the session number was indicated as a Roman numeral in parentheses after the resolution number.
(i) General Assembly resolutions.
General Assembly resolutions are cited by resolution number and date:
G.A. Res. 832 (IX), at 19 (Oct. 21, 1954).
G.A. Res. 47/163, ¶ 5 (Dec. 18, 1992).
(ii) General Assembly decisions.
General Assembly decisions are cited by resolution number and date:
G.A. Dec. 62/557, U.N. Doc. A/63/49 (Vol. III), at 106 (Sep. 15, 2008).
(iii) General Assembly resolutions known by a popular name.
For General Assembly resolutions known by a specific title (e.g., the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
), or for resolutions whose title is important in the context cited, insert the title after the resolution number. Note that some documents or statements, such as the last of the three below, are included as annexes to resolutions and need to be identified as such:
G.A. Res. 217 (III) A, Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Dec. 10, 1948).
G.A. Res. 60/1, 2005 World Summit Outcome (Sep. 16, 2005).
G.A. Res. 47/135, annex, Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities (Dec. 18, 1992).
(b) Security Council resolutions.
Security Council resolutions and statements of the Security Council President are cited by resolution number and date:
S.C. Res. 508, ¶ 3 (June 5, 1982).
S.C. Res. 1325, ¶ 8 (Oct. 31, 2000).
S.C. President Statement 2008/48 (Dec. 22, 2008).
(c) Resolutions issued by other organs.
Resolutions issued by other U.N. organs should be cited analogously to General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. List the title of the U.N. organ first:
Economic and Social Council Res. 1990/26 (May 24, 1990).
Trusteeship Council Res. 2014 (XXVI), at 2 (June 1, 1960).
(d) Resolutions by subsidiary bodies.

note 1, ¶ 2.
H.R.C. Res. 5/1,
