Handwritten and Typewritten Documents
(pp. 254–55)
(a) Typeface.
When citing handwritten materials, default to using ordinary roman typeface for any document titles and/or quotes, regardless of the type of handwriting used. If, however, an author appears to use cursive script selectively for emphasis, use italics. When a document contains lines to be filled with form responses, do not use underlining when quoting the text which fills those lined areas.
(b) In-text deletions.
When handwritten or typewritten documents contains crossed-out or deleted text that are still intelligible, you may omit such text when quoting the material without any parenthetical. If quoting the material for the proposition that specific information was crossed out, you may use the deleted materials. If quoting the crossed-out words or phrases in the context of a larger quotation, use the strikethrough typeface. If citing the crossed out words or phrases in isolation, you may use regular romanized typeface, but you must include the parenthetical “

(c) Unintelligible script.
Exercise caution when citing documents with any handwritten or typewritten text that is unintelligible due to the quality of the handwriting, fading, or any obstruction (e.g., inkblots). When quoting such materials, omit any unintelligible text using ellipses (see
rule 5.3
). When doing so, include “
