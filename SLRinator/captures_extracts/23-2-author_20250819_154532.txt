For signed materials appearing in periodicals (including student-written materials), follow
rule 15.1
, but print in ordinary roman type:

].
(b) Author unavailable.
If the archived document is not contemporaneously signed, omit this field. Subsequent speculation on the author’s identity is inadequate for the purposes of this rule. However, akin to
rule 15.1(d)
, if the document has been verifiably attributed to an author, you may use that author’s name. Such an exception to
rule 23.2(b)
should be used sparingly, and only where secondary sources are clear and confident as to the author’s identity, or where the author has later claimed the work.
(c) Pen names.
When a pen name or alias is used, cite the author according to
rule 15.1(d)
.
(d) Letters, memoranda, and press releases.
If the document is an archived letter, memorandum, or press release, format the document’s author according to
rule 17.2.3
:
Letter from William Prosser, Dean, Univ. of Cal., Berkley, Sch. of L., to Robert Hudec, Ed.-in-Chief, Yale L.J. (Apr. 27, 1960) (on file with Yale L.J., General Archives, 1960s-1970s Correspondence, Box 1, Folder 6).
