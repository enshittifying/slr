Case Materials
(pp. 253–54)
23.7.1 –
Justices' Papers
This rule applies to the collections of compiled papers from U.S. Supreme Court Justices. With minor alterations, it also applies to any similar collections from other judges’ papers.
(a) Author.
When referring to Justices’ papers archived in official collections authored by the Justice themselves, retain the honorific “
Justice
” before the author’s name. This rule applies the same for any other judge:
Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., Case Notes, at LII, Emps. of the Dep’t of Pub. Health & Welfare v. Dep’t of Pub. Health & Welfare, No. 71-1021 (1972) (on file with Libr. of Cong., William J. Brennan, Jr. Papers, Box II:6, Folder 16).
If citing a document authored by a law clerk, a judicial assistant, secretary, or other staff member, include their position and court affiliation. Abbreviate the court affiliation according to
tables T6
,
T7
, and
T10
:
J. Harvie Wilkinson III, Law Clerk, U.S. Sup. Ct., Certiorari Memorandum 2, Emps. of the Dep’t of Pub. Health & Welfare v. Dep’t of Pub. Health & Welfare, No. 71-1021 (Mar. 20, 1972) (on file with Wash. & Lee Univ. Sch. of L., Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Papers, Box 380, Folder 7).
You may use initials and a date to identify law clerks.
(b) Case information.
When a Justice’s papers refer to a specific case, include the case name and docket number after the document name and pincite. Omit cases’ reporter information unless the docket number is unavailable:
Justice William Rehnquist, Third Draft Opinion 13, Edelman v. Jordan, No. 72-1410 (Jan. 17, 1974) (on file with Wash. & Lee Univ. Sch. of L., Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Papers, Box 399, Folders 1-3).
23.7.2 –
Other Case Documents
(a) Administrative proceedings.
For documents filed during administrative proceedings, cite the title of the document as you would any archival title. If the document is an exhibit, you may indicate so in the title of the document as well. For the institutional affiliation (
rule 23.4
), indicate the name of the agency tribunal and the case number of the matter at issue, whenever available. When dealing with materials from state agencies, be sure to include the correct state abbreviation (
table T10
) before the tribunal name:
Brooklyn Borough Gas Co. Contract, Exhibit No. 12, N.Y. Pub. Serv. Comm’n, No. 15309 (Feb. 28, 1951) (on file with N.Y. State Archives, Reel 811).
(b) Other courts.
Cite materials from other courts, including non–Article III courts, state courts, foreign courts, and international law courts according to
rule 23.7.1
, but use the usual case citation rather than the docket number. Include the correct jurisdiction and court name in the date parenthetical as per
rule 10.4
:
Judge Benjamin Cardozo, Case Notes,
In re
Adler, 173 N.E. 265 (N.Y. 1930) (on file with Harv. L. Sch. Libr., Historical & Special Collections, Benjamin N. Cardozo Papers, Box 1, Folder 5).
