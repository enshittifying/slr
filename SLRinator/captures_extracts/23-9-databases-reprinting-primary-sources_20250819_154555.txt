(p.254)
When originally unpublished materials covered by

that were published in hard-copy compilations are subsequently reprinted in an online database, you may cite to that online database. The citation should include in small capitals both the names of the database’s owner abbreviated according to
rule 18.2.2(b)
and the database:
Thomas Jefferson, Notes on British and American Alienage (c. 1783),
reprinted by
Nat’l Archives: Founders Online

“Reprinting” does not refer to primary source databases that display original images of the documents, which should remain cited according to the standard archival citation format.
