Archival Sources
(p.249)
This rule applies to materials found in archives, and thus will primarily apply to (1) historical documents created before the internet era, (2) documents where a digital file no longer exists, and (3) physical objects.
Published materials, including books (
rule 15
) or letters found compiled in a published book (
rule 15.5.2(a)
), generally do not fall within the ambit of
rule 23
. The principal exception is where originally unpublished texts compiled in published works are then reprinted in digital archives (
rule 23.9
).
When a document or object is on file with an organized and official archive,
rule 23
supplants
rule 17
, and “
(on file with author)
” should not be used.
