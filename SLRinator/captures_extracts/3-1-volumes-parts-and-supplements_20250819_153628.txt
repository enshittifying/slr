3.1
Volumes, Parts, and Supplements
(pp. 76–77)
A single work often appears in separately paginated (or sectioned or paragraphed) volumes, parts, or supplements. A citation to material that appears in one such volume, part, or supplement must identify the separately paginated subdivision in which the material appears.
(a) Volumes.
When the volumes are numbered, cite the volume number in Arabic numerals. If the author(s) of the entire work (all volumes) is cited, the volume number precedes the author’s name:
2
Frederick Pollock & Frederic William Maitland, The History of English Law
205–06 (2d ed. 1911).
2
Subcomm. on Labor of the S. Comm. on Labor & Public Welfare, 92d Cong., Legislative History of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of
1972, at 1007 (1972).
Otherwise, the volume number precedes the volume’s title:
Donald H. Zeigler,
Young Adults as a Cognizable Group in Jury Selection
, 76
Mich. L. Rev
. 1045, 1047 (1978).
If no volume number is given but the volume is readily identifiable by year, use the year of the volume as the volume number and omit the year after the pincite:
Thomas R. McCoy & Barry Friedman,
Conditional Spending: Federalism’s Trojan Horse
, 1988
Sup. Ct. Rev.
85, 88.
Donald A. Dripps,
Delegation and Due Process
, 1988
Duke L.J
. 657.
If the volume designation includes words, use brackets to avoid confusion:
[1977–1978 Transfer Binder] Bankr. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶ 66,472
If volumes are numbered in a new series each year, give both the year and volume number, bracketing the year and placing it before the volume number to avoid confusion:
[1943] 2 K.B. 154
(b) Separately paginated numbered parts.
When a work is divided into separately paginated (or sectioned or paragraphed) series, books, chapters, or other parts, include the relevant subdivisions in the citation:
26
Cong. Rec
. app. at 156 (1894) (statement of Rep. Josiah Hicks).
ser. 14, pt. 2, at 150
pt. 3, § 4, at 15
(c) Supplements.
When citing a separately paginated (or sectioned or paragraphed) supplement, identify the supplement and its date in parentheses:
Haw. Rev. Stat
. § 296-46.1 (Supp. 1984).
George Gleason Bogert, The Law of Trusts and Trustees
§ 496 (rev. 2d ed. Supp. 1985).
To cite both the main volume and the supplement, use an ampersand:
42 U.S.C. § 1397b (1982 & Supp. I 1983).
