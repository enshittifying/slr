CONTENT:
3.2
Pages, Footnotes, Endnotes, and Graphical Materials
(pp. 77–80)
(a) Pages.
Give the page number or numbers before the date parenthetical, without any introductory abbreviation (“
p.
” and “
pp.
” are used only in internal cross-references (
rule 3.5
)):
Arthur E. Sutherland, Constitutionalism in America
45 (1965).
H.R. Rep. No.
82-353, at 4–5 (1951).
Use “
at
” if the page number may be confused with another part of the citation; use a comma to set off “
at.
” Use this form, for example, when the title of a work ends with an Arabic numeral or when the work uses Roman numerals for pagination:
Biographical Directory of the Governors of the United States
1978–1983, at 257 (Robert Sobel & John W. Raimo eds., 1983).
Thomas I. Emerson,
Foreword
to
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Sexual Harassment of Working Women,
at vii, ix (1979).
If an article, case, or other source within a larger source is not separately paginated, cite the page on which the item begins:
Bernard L. Diamond,
The Psychiatric Prediction of Dangerousness
, 123 U.
Pa. L. Rev
. 439 (1974).
United States v. Bruno, 144 F. Supp. 593 (N.D. Ill. 1955).
Government Employees Training Act, Pub. L. No. 85-507, 72 Stat. 327 (1958).
When referring to specific material within such a source, include both the page on which the source begins and the page on which the specific material appears (a pincite), separated by a comma:
Matthew Roskoski, Note,
A Case-by-Case Approach to Pleading Scienter Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
, 97
Mich. L. Rev
. 2265, 2271–75 (1999).
Catharine A. MacKinnon
,
On Exceptionality: Women as Women in Law
,
in
Feminism Unmodified
70, 76–77 (1987).
When referring specifically to material on the first page of a source, repeat the page number:
Christina M. Fernández, Note,
Beyond
Marvin
: A Proposal for Quasi-Spousal Support
, 30
Stan. L. Rev.
359, 359 (1978).
When citing material within a concurring or dissenting opinion, give only the initial page of the case and the page on which the specific material appears, not the initial page of the concurring or dissenting opinion:
Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 297 (1962) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).
When citing material that spans more than one page, give the inclusive page numbers, separated by an en dash (–) or hyphen (-). Always retain the last two digits, but drop other repetitious digits:
Edward L. Rubin, Note,
Fairness, Flexibility, and the Waiver of Remedial Rights by Contract
, 87
Yale L.J
. 1057, 1065–69 (1978).
If a hyphen or dash would be ambiguous because of the page numbering system, use the word “
to
”:
Boris I. Bittker & James S. Eustice, Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders
¶ 5.06, at 5-31 to -32 (5th abr. ed. 1987).
Cite nonconsecutive pages by giving the individual page numbers separated by commas:
Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529, 531, 546 (1976).
If a source uses star paging (such as “
*3
”), drop the star in the ending page number of a page range, but keep the star in all references to nonconsecutive pages:
2
William Blackstone, Commentaries
*152, *155–56.
When a claim is often repeated throughout the entire source, use “
passim
” rather than citing specific pages. Do not insert a comma after the initial page number:
Linda S. Mullenix,
The Constitutionality of the Proposed Rule 23 Class Action Amendments
, 39
Ariz. L. Rev
. 615
passim
(1997).
(b) Footnotes.
To cite a footnote, give the page on which the footnote appears, “
n.
,” and the footnote number, with no space between “
n.
” and the number:
Akhil Reed Amar,
The Two-Tiered Structure of the Judiciary Act of 1789
, 138
U. Pa. L. Rev
. 1499, 1525 n.80 (1990).
To cite a footnote that spans more than one page, cite only the page on which the footnote begins, “
n.
,” and the footnote number:
Akhil Reed Amar,
The Two-Tiered Structure of the Judiciary Act of 1789
, 138
U. Pa. L. Rev
. 1499, 1560 n.222 (1990).
When referring only to specific pages of a footnote that spans more than one page, cite only the specific pages, rather than the page on which the footnote begins:
Akhil Reed Amar,
The Two-Tiered Structure of the Judiciary Act of 1789
, 138
U. Pa. L. Rev
. 1499, 1561–62 n.222 (1990).
To cite both a range of pages and also a single footnote that appears within the page range, cite the page range followed by a comma and then cite the footnote in the typical manner:
Akhil Reed Amar,
The Two-Tiered Structure of the Judiciary Act of 1789
, 138
U. Pa. L. Rev
1499, 1523–24, 1524 n.75 (1990).
Cite multiple footnotes (or endnotes) by using “
nn.
”:
141 nn.180–86
Treat nonconsecutive footnotes (or endnotes) like nonconsecutive pages, but (except for internal cross-references) substitute an ampersand for the comma separating two footnotes that appear on the same page or the final comma in a list of three or more footnotes that appear on the same page:
350 n.12, 355 n.18
291 nn.14 & 18, 316 nn.4, 6 & 8–9
To refer to both a page in the text and a footnote that begins on that page, use an ampersand between the page and the note number:
Irene Merker Rosenberg, Essay, Winship
Redux: 1970 to 1990
, 69
Tex. L. Rev.
109, 123 & n.90 (1990).
(c) Endnotes.
To cite an endnote, give the page on which the endnote appears (not the page on which the call number appears), “
n.
,” and the endnote number, with no space between “
n.
” and the number:
John Hart Ely, Democracy and Distrust
215 n.85 (1980).
To refer to both a page in text and an endnote that has a call appearing on that page, use an ampersand between the text page and the page on which the endnote appears. In the following example, the cited text is on p. 61 and the endnote is on p. 215:
John Hart Ely, Democracy and Distrust
61 & 215 n.85 (1980).
Otherwise, cite endnotes in the same manner as footnotes.
(d) Graphical materials.
When citing tables, figures, charts, graphs, or other graphical materials, give the page number on which the graphical material appears and the designation, if any, provided in the source. Use the abbreviations in
table T16
. For photographs and “art-type” objects, see
rule 18.9
:
Kevin M. Clermont & Theodore Eisenberg, Commentary,
Xenophilia in American Courts
, 109
Harv. L.
Rev
. 1120, 1131 tbl. 2 (1996).
Jennifer Gerarda Brown & Ian Ayres,
Economic Rationales for Mediation
, 80
Va. L. Rev
. 323, 397 fig. 6 (1994).
To refer to multiple charts, tables, figures, etc., on the same page, pluralize the abbreviated designation according to
table T16
. Use commas and ampersands, not en dashes, to separate:
9 figs. 3 & 4
1236 tbls. 1, 2 & 3
