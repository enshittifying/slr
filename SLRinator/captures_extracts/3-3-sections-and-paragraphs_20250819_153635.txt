3.3
Sections and Paragraphs
(pp. 80–81)
If an authority is organized by section (
§
) or paragraph (
¶
), cite to these subdivisions:
15 U.S.C. § 18 (1982).
Max Gutierrez, Jr.,
Estate Planning for the Unmarried Cohabitant
, 13
Mia. Inst. on Est. Plan.
¶ 1600 (1979).
A page number may also be provided if useful in locating specific matter within the section or paragraph:
Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law
§ 15-4, at 1314, § 15-6, at 1320 (2d ed. 1988).
If an authority is organized in part by indented paragraphs not introduced by paragraph symbols (
¶
), do not cite such paragraphs with the symbol. Instead use the written abbreviation (
para
.):
The Declaration of Independence
para. 2 (U.S. 1776).
Do not cite indented paragraphs if the authority is ordinarily cited by page:
Mandela Trial Scheduled Today
, USA
Today
, Feb. 4, 1991, at A4.
Do not use “
at
” before a section or paragraph symbol:
Id.
§ 7.
Not:
Id.
at § 7.
Gutierrez,
supra
note 5, ¶ 1600.
Not:
Gutierrez,
supra
note 5, at ¶ 1600.
Rule 6.2(c)
discusses the use of section and paragraph symbols.
To cite session laws amending prior acts that are divided into sections within sections, see
rule 12.4(d)
.
(a) Subsections.
If the source contains punctuation separating sections from subsections, use the original punctuation:
N.M. Stat. Ann. §
4-44-7
(G) (1983).
Not:
N.M. Stat. Ann.
§ 4(44)(7)(G) (1983).
If the source contains no such separating punctuation, separate the subsection designations using parentheses, not decimals, hyphens, or other marks. Thus, place “1” and “a” in parentheses (“
(1)
” and “
(a)
”).
(b) Multiple sections and subsections.
When citing multiple sections, use two section symbols (
§§
). Give inclusive numbers; do not use “
et seq.
” Identical digits or letters preceding a punctuation mark may be omitted, unless doing so would create confusion. Otherwise retain all digits:
Wash. Rev. Code Ann.
§§ 18.51.005–.52.900 (West 1989 & Supp. 1991).
Del. Code Ann.
tit. 9, §§ 817–819 (1989).
Note that letters are sometimes used to designate sections, rather than subsections, and that section designations may contain punctuation within them:
42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a–1396d.
If an en dash or hyphen would be ambiguous, use the word “
to
”:
42 U.S.C. §§ 1973aa-2 to -4.
Mont. Code Ann.
§§ 75-1-301 to -324 (1989).
When citing scattered sections, separate the sections with commas:
N.J. Stat. Ann.
§§ 18A:54-1, -3, -6 (West 1989).
Repeat digits if necessary to avoid confusion:
N.J. Stat. Ann.
§§ 18A:58-17, :58-25, :64A-22.1, :64A-22.6 (West 1989).
When citing multiple subsections within a
single
section, use only one section symbol:
28 U.S.C. § 105(a)(3)–(b)(1).
19 U.S.C. § 1485(a)(1)–(3).
Del. Code Ann.
tit. 9, § 6910(a), (c) (1989).
But when citing multiple subsections within
different
sections, use two section symbols:
19 U.S.C. §§ 1485(a), 1486(b).
(c) Multiple paragraphs.
Multiple paragraphs should be treated like multiple sections, following
rule 3.3(b)
:
1
Blue Sky L. Rep
. (CCH) ¶¶ 4471–4474.
(d) Flush language and examples.
When the source is organized by section or paragraph, but the text being cited is flush language or an example, indicate this fact in a parenthetical immediately following the section or paragraph identifier, as follows:
I.R.C. § 960(c) (flush language).
Treas. Reg. § 1.704-2(m) (ex. 1(ii)).
