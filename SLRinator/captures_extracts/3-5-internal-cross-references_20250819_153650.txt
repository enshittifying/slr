Internal Cross-References
(pp. 82–83)
Portions of text, footnotes, and groups of authorities within the piece may be cited using “
supra
” or “
infra
.
” Use
supra
to refer to material that has already appeared within the piece. Use
infra
to refer to material that appears later in the piece. Always retain the last two digits, but drop other repetitious digits.
Use a consistent naming convention for subdivisions that are numbered or otherwise designated in the piece.
The Bluebook
suggests using “
Part
” for main subdivisons and “
Section
” for all smaller subdivisions; use “
note
” to refer to footnotes within the same piece; use “
p.
” and “
pp.
” to refer to other pages within the same piece;
use
“
Figure
” and “
Table
” to refer to figures and tables within the same piece. A variety of forms may be used. For example:
See
supra
text accompanying notes 305–07.
See
supra
notes 12–15, 92–97 and accompanying text.
