CONTENT:
4.2
“
Supra
” and “Hereinafter”
(pp. 85–87)
“
Supra
” and “
hereinafter
” may be used to refer to legislative hearings; court filings; books; pamphlets; reports; unpublished materials; nonprint resources; periodicals; services; treaties and international agreements; regulations, directives, and decisions of intergovernmental organizations; and internal cross-references. “
Supra
” and “
hereinafter
” should not be used to refer to cases, statutes, constitutions, legislative materials or debates (other than hearings), restatements, model codes, or regulations, except in extraordinary circumstances, such as when the name of the authority is extremely long:
26
In re
Multidistrict Private Civ. Treble Damage Antitrust Litig. Involving Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Equip., 52 F.R.D. 398 (C.D. Cal. 1970) [hereinafter
Air Pollution Control Antitrust Case
].
Appropriate short forms for cases, statutes, and legislative materials or debates (other than hearings) are provided in their respective rules.
(a) “
Supra.
”
When an authority has been fully cited previously, the “
supra
” form may be used (unless “
id
.
” is appropriate or “
supra
” is inappropriate for that authority). The “
supra
” form generally consists of the last name of the author of the work, followed by a comma and the word “
supra
.” Indicate any particular manner in which the subsequent citation differs from the former.
If the author is an institutional author, use the full institutional name. If no author is cited, use the title of the work; for unsigned student-written law review materials, use the appropriate designation (see
rule 16.7.1(b)
).
Indicate the footnote in which the full citation can be found, unless the full citation is in the same footnote, in which case “
supra
” should be used without any cross-reference. Indicate any particular manner in which the subsequent citation differs from the former. Volume, paragraph, section, page numbers, or timestamps may be added to refer to specific material:

(b) “Hereinafter.”
For authority that would be cumbersome to cite with the usual “
supra
” form or for which the regular shortened form may confuse the reader, the author may establish a specific shortened form. After the first citation of the authority, but before any explanatory parenthetical, place the word “
hereinafter
” and the shortened form in brackets. The shortened form should appear in the same typeface as in the full citation.  In subsequent citations, cite the authority using the shortened form followed by a comma and the appropriate “
supra
” cross-reference (
rule 4.2(a)
):

Do not use the “
hereinafter
” form when a simple “
supra
” form is adequate:

The “

” form, however, should be used to distinguish two authorities appearing in the same footnote if the simple “

” form would be confusing:
