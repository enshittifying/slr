5.1
Formatting of Quotations
(pp. 87–88)
(a) Quotations of fifty or more words.
(i) Indentation and quotation marks.
The quotation should be indented on the left and right, single spaced, fully justified, without quotation marks, and quotation marks within a block quotation should appear as they do in the original:
[T]his presumptive privilege must be considered in light of our historic commitment to the rule of law. This is nowhere more profoundly manifest than in our view that “the twofold aim [of criminal justice] is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.” We have elected to employ an adversary system of criminal justice in which the parties contest all issues before a court of law . . . . The ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or speculative presentation of the facts. The very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the facts, within the framework of the rules of evidence. To ensure that justice is done, it is imperative to the function of courts that compulsory process be available for the production of evidence needed either by the prosecution or by the defense.
United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 708–09 (1974) (second alteration in original) (citation omitted). The Court then balanced this interest against the evils of forced disclosure.

(ii) Footnote and citation placement.
In law review text (in which citations are not permitted), the footnote number should appear after the final punctuation of the quotation. In law review footnotes, court documents, and legal memoranda (in which citations are permitted), the citation should not be indented but should begin at the left margin on the line immediately following the quotation. In law review footnotes, where the quotation is placed within a parenthetical, it should be enclosed in quotation marks and not otherwise set off from the rest of the text.
(iii) Paragraph structure.
The paragraph structure of an indented quotation should be indicated by further indenting the first line of each paragraph. The first sentence of the first quoted paragraph is only indented, however, if the first word of the quoted passage is also the first word of a paragraph in the source being quoted. If language at the beginning of the first paragraph is omitted, do not indent the first line or use an ellipsis. To indicate omission at the beginning of subsequent paragraphs, insert and indent an ellipsis. Indicate the omission of one or more entire paragraphs by inserting and indenting four periods (“. . . .”) on a new line. The following example illustrates these rules:
On appeal to the federal courts via a habeas petition, McCleskey alleged that Georgia’s capital sentencing process was administered in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. McCleskey based his claims on a study, conducted by respected law and economics Professors Baldus, Pulaski, and Woodworth . . . . The Baldus study examined roughly 2,500 murder cases . . . .
. . . .
. . . Professors Baldus, Pulaski, and Woodworth also subjected their data to an extensive statistical analysis.
(b) Quotations of forty-nine or fewer words.
(i) Indentation and quotation marks.
The quotation should be enclosed in quotation marks but not otherwise set off from the rest of the text. Quotation marks around material quoted inside another quote should appear as single marks within the quotation in keeping with the standard convention.
(ii) Footnote and citation placement.
The footnote number or citation should follow immediately after the closing quotation mark unless it is more accurate to place it elsewhere shortly before or after the quotation.
(iii) Paragraph structure.
Do not indicate the original paragraph structure of quotations of forty-nine or fewer words except when the material quoted would commonly be set off from the text, such as lines of poetry or dialogue from a play. In this case, the quotation may appear as a block quote per
rule 5.1(a)(i)
, regardless of its length.
(iv) Punctuation.
Always place commas and periods inside the quotation marks; place other punctuation marks inside the quotation marks only if they are part of the original text.
