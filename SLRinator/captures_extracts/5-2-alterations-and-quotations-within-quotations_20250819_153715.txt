5.2
Alterations and Quotations Within Quotations
(pp. 88–90)
(a) Substitution of letters or words.
When a letter must be changed from upper to lower case, or vice versa, enclose it in brackets. Substituted words or letters and other inserted material should also be bracketed:
“[P]ublic confidence in the [adversary] system depend[s upon] full disclosure of all the facts, within the framework of the rules of evidence.”
(b) Omission of letters.
Indicate the omission of letters from a common root word with empty brackets (“
judgment[]
”).
(c) Mistakes in original.
Significant mistakes in the original should be followed by “
[sic]
” and otherwise left as they appear in the original:
“This list of statutes are [sic] necessarily incomplete.”
(d) Changes to citations.
(i) Use a parenthetical clause after the citation to indicate when the source quoted contains any addition of emphasis, alteration to the original in the quoted text, or any omission of citations, emphasis, or footnote call numbers. When a citation requires multiple parentheticals, place them in the order indicated in
rule 1.5(b)
:
“The fact that individuals define themselves in a significant way through their sexual relationships suggests . . . that much of the richness of a relationship will come from the freedom to
choose
the form and nature of these
intensely personal bonds
.” Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 205 (1986) (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (second emphasis added).
The court of appeals recognized the city’s substantial interest in limiting the sound emanating from the bandshell. The court concluded, however, that the city’s sound-amplification guideline was not narrowly tailored to further this interest, because “it has not [been] shown . . . that the requirement of the use of the city’s sound system and technician was the
least intrusive means
of regulating the volume.”
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 797 (1989) (alteration in original) (citation omitted).
(ii) Do not indicate the omission of a citation or footnote call number that follows the last word quoted.
(iii) Do not indicate that emphasis in the quotation appears in the original.
(e) Quotations within quotations.
Whenever possible, a quotation within a quotation should be attributed to its original source. Insert a parenthetical following any parenthetical required by
rule 5.2(d)
:
Chief Judge J. Skelly Wright noted Congress’s “
firm resolve
to insure that the CIA’s ‘power that flows from money and stealth’ could not be turned loose in domestic investigations of Americans.” Marks v. CIA, 590 F.2d 997, 1008 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (Wright, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis added) (quoting Weissman v. CIA, 565 F.2d 692, 695 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).
Note that sources included in parentheticals pursuant to this rule should be formatted as though they appear in citation clauses (see
rules 2.1
and
2.2(b)(iii)
).
(f) Internal quotation marks.
(i) Internal quotation marks should be omitted if the opening mark appears at the very beginning of an in-line quotation and the closing mark appears at the very end:
Original: If “the agency’s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,” that is the end of the matter.
The dispositive question is whether “the agency’s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.”
Not:
The dispositive question is whether “‘the agency’s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.’”
(ii) Do not omit multiple levels of nested marks except as this rule allows, even though “
quoting
” parentheticals beyond the first level may be omitted under
rule 10.6.3
. Alternate between double and single quotation marks as appropriate:
Original: In this context, “the distinction between ‘jurisdictional’ and ‘non-jurisdictional’ interpretations is a mirage.”
The Court noted that, “[i]n this context, ‘the distinction between “jurisdictional” and “non-jurisdictional” interpretations is a mirage.’”
Not:
The Court noted that, “[i]n this context, ‘the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional interpretations is a mirage.’”
(iii) Do not fail to include a “
quoting
” parenthetical because this rule requires omission of internal quotation marks (rather, omit “
quoting
” parentheticals only as allowed by
rule 10.6.3
).
(iv) Do not omit internal quotation marks in block quotations.
