Omissions
(pp. 90–91)
Omission of a word or words is generally indicated by the insertion of an ellipsis, three periods separated by spaces and set off by a space before the first and after the last period (“
.
.
.
”), to take the place of the word or words omitted. Note that “
” indicates a space.
An ellipsis should never be used to begin a quotation, nor should it be used when individual words are merely altered (
rules 5.1(a)(iii)
and
5.2
).
(a) When using quoted language as a phrase or clause.
Do not indicate omission of matters before or after a quotation:
Chief Justice Burger wrote that the availability of compulsory process is “imperative to the function of courts” and that “[t]he very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the facts.”
However, indicate omission of matter within such a phrase or clause with an ellipsis:
Chief Justice Burger wrote that the availability of compulsory process is “imperative to
.
.
.
courts” and that “[t]he
.
.
.
judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the facts.”
(b) When using quoted language as a full sentence.
For example, assume the text of the original language is as follows:
National borders are less of a barrier to economic exchange now than at almost any other time in history. As economic activity continues its relentless drive toward world-wide scope, trademarks become even more important. Why, then, are certain scholars advocating less comprehensive trademark protection? In fact, this seems counterintuitive.
(i) Where the
beginning
of the quoted sentence is being omitted, capitalize the first letter of the quoted language and place it in brackets if it is not already capitalized:
“[B]orders are less of a barrier to economic exchange now than at almost any other time in history.”
(ii) Where the
middle
of a quoted sentence is omitted, insert an ellipsis where the language is omitted:
“National borders are less of a barrier
.
.
.
now than at almost any other time in history.”
(iii) Where the
end
of a quoted sentence is omitted, insert an ellipsis between the last word being quoted and the final punctuation of the sentence being quoted:
“National borders are less of a barrier to economic exchange now than at almost any other time
.
.
.
.”
(iv) Do not indicate the deletion of matter after the period or other final punctuation that concludes the last quoted sentence:
“National borders are less of a barrier to economic exchange now than at almost any other time in history.”
(v) Where language
after the end
of a quoted sentence is deleted and is followed by further quotation, retain the punctuation at the end of the quoted sentence and insert an ellipsis before the remainder of the quotation:
“National borders are less of a barrier to economic exchange now than at almost any other time in history.
.
.
.
[E]conomic activity continues its relentless drive toward world-wide scope, [so] trademarks become even more important.”
(vi) If language both
at the end
and
after the end
of a quoted sentence is omitted and followed by further quoted material, use only one ellipsis to indicate both of the omissions:
“National borders are less of a barrier
.
.
.
.
[E]conomic activity continues its relentless drive toward world-wide scope, [so] trademarks become even more important.”
Note that the punctuation at the end of the first sentence should follow the ellipsis:
“Why, then, are certain scholars advocating less
.
.
.
? [T]his seems counterintuitive.”
(c) When omitting a footnote or citation.
Indicate omission of a footnote or a citation with the parenthetical phrase “
(footnote omitted)
” or “
(citation omitted)
” immediately following the citation to the quoted source. Do not insert an ellipsis for an omitted footnote or citation.
