6.1
Abbreviations
(pp. 92–93)
Tables at the end of this book contain lists of specific abbreviations for arbitral reporters (
T5
), case names, institutional author names, and common words in periodical titles (
T6
), court names (
T7
), explanatory phrases (
T8
), legislative documents (
T9
), geographical terms (
T10
), judges and officials (
T11
), months (
T12
), institutional names in periodical titles (
T13
), publishing terms (
T14
), services (
T15
), and subdivisions (
T16
).
Abbreviations not listed in this book should be avoided unless substantial space will be saved and the resulting abbreviation is unambiguous.
Note that in legal writing the same word may be abbreviated differently for different uses:
F.
and
Fed.
app.
and
App’x
(a) Spacing.
In general, close up all adjacent single capitals:
N.W.
S.D.N.Y.
But do not close up single capitals with longer abbreviations:
D. Mass.
S. Ct.
In abbreviations of periodical names (see
tables T6
and
T13
), close up all adjacent single capitals except when one or more of the capitals refers to the name of an institutional entity, in which case set the capital or capitals referring to the entity off from other adjacent single capitals with a space. Thus:
Geo. L.J.
B.C. L. Rev.
N.Y.U. L. Rev.
S. Ill. U. L.J.
Individual numbers, including both numerals and ordinals, are treated as single capitals:
F.3d
S.E.2d
A.L.R.4th
But, insert a space adjacent to any abbreviation containing two or more letters:
So. 2d
Cal. App. 3d
F. Supp. 2d
Close up initials in personal names:
W.C. Fields
(b) Periods.
Generally, every abbreviation should be followed by a period, except those in which the last letter of the original word is set off from the rest of the abbreviation by an apostrophe. Thus:
Ave.
Bldg.
But:
Ass’n
Dep’t
Some entities with widely recognized initials, e.g.,
AARP, CBS, CIA, EPA, FCC, FDA, FEC, NAACP
, and
NLRB
, are commonly referred to in spoken language by their initials rather than by their full names; such abbreviations may be used without periods in text, in case names, and as institutional authors. Do not, however, omit the periods when the abbreviations are used as reporter names, in names of codes, or as names of courts of decision. Thus:
City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290 (2013).
But:
Arlington Radio Serv., Inc., 6 F.C.C. 378 (1938).
United States may be abbreviated to “
U.S.
” only when used as an adjective (do not omit the periods):
U.S. history
But:
history of the United States
In addition to the abbreviation “
U.S.
,” always retain periods in abbreviations not commonly referred to in speech as initials (e.g.,
N.Y.
,
S.D.
).
