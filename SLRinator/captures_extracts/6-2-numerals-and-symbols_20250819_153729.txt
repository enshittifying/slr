Numerals and Symbols
(pp. 93–94)
(a) Numerals.
In general, spell out the numbers zero to ninety-nine in text and in footnotes; for larger numbers, use numerals. This general rule is subject, however, to the following exceptions:
(i) Any number that
begins a sentence
must be spelled out.
(ii) “
Hundred
,” “
thousand
,” and similar
round numbers
may be spelled out, if done consistently.
(iii) When a series includes numbers both less than 100 and greater than or equal to 100, numerals should be used for the entire series:
The plaintiffs gained, respectively, 117, 6, and 28 pounds.
(iv) Numerals should be used if the number includes a decimal point.
(v) Where material repeatedly refers to percentages or dollar amounts, numerals should be used for those percentages or amounts.
(vi) Numerals should be used for section or other subdivision numbers.
(vii) In numbers that appear in text and citations, use commas to separate groups of three digits when those numbers contain four or more uninterrupted digits.  Thus:
1,234,567
Do not employ this convention in citations to pages, statutes, volume numbers, internet database locators, docket numbers, the U.S. Code, or other sources whose classification systems do not themselves include commas:
United States v. Walker, No. 00-40098-JAR, 2003 WL 131711 (D. Kan. Jan. 6, 2003).
(b) Ordinals.
(i) Unless part of a citation, ordinal numbers appearing in text and footnotes are controlled by
rule 6.2(a)
. If part of a citation, numerals are used for all ordinal numbers. Do not use superscripts:
41st Leg.
4th ed.
(ii) In textual sentences, where
rule 6.2(a)
requires that the numeral be used, use “
2nd
” or “
3rd
” for figures representing ordinal numbers ending in two or three. But, in citations, for figures representing ordinal numbers ending in the number two or three, use “
2d
” or “
3d
,” not “
2nd
” or “
3rd
.” Do not use superscripts in any case. Thus:
The 102nd Congress could not pass a rule that would bind the 103rd Congress.
But, in citations:
103d Cong.
2d ed.
(c) Section (§) and paragraph (¶) symbols.
The first word of any sentence must be spelled out. In addition, spell out the words “
section
” and “
paragraph
” in the text (whether main text or footnote text) of law review pieces and other documents, except when referring to a provision in the U.S. Code (see
rule 12.10(c)
) or a federal regulation (see
rule 14.6
). In citations, the symbols should be used (except when citing session laws amending prior acts as noted in rule
12.4(d)
). When the symbols are used, insert a space between “
§
” or “
¶
” and the numeral. See
rules 3.3(b)
and
3.3(c)
when citing to multiple sections or paragraphs.
(d) Dollar ($) and percent (%) symbols.
These symbols should be used wherever numerals are used, and the words should be spelled out wherever numbers are spelled out, but a symbol should never begin a sentence. There should
not
be a space between “
$
” or “
%
” and the numeral.
