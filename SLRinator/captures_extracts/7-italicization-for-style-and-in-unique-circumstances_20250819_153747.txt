Italicization for Style and in Unique Circumstances
(pp. 95–96)
See
rule 2
for a general discussion on the uses of typefaces. The conventions below apply to italicization for emphasis, italicization of foreign words and phrases, and italicization in other unique circumstances.
(a) Emphasis.
Words and phrases may be italicized for emphasis.
(b) Foreign words and phrases.
Italicize non-English words and phrases unless they have been incorporated into common English usage. But do not italicize text from languages that do not use the Roman alphabet, such as Mandarin Chinese or Modern Standard Arabic. Latin words and phrases that are often used in legal writing are considered to be in common English usage and should not be italicized. However, very long Latin phrases and obsolete or uncommon Latin words and phrases should remain italicized. For example:
expressio unius est exclusio alterius
ignorantia legis neminem excusat
sero sed serio
ex dolo malo non oritur actio
But:
e.g.
i.e.
res judicata
quid pro quo
amicus curiae
certiorari
corpus juris
ab initio
obiter dictum
de jure
modus operandi
habeas corpus
non obstante veredicto
prima facie
mens rea
en banc
Note, however, that “
id.
” is always italicized. Note also that other typeface rules may control. For example, when “
e.g.
” is used as a signal it should be italicized as per
rule 2.1(d)
. Similarly, always italicize procedural phrases in case names, such as “
In re
” or “
ex rel.
,” under
rule 10.2.1(b)
.
(c) Letters representing hypothetical parties, places, or things.
Italicize and capitalize individual letters when used to represent the names of hypothetical parties, places, or things:
A
went to bank
B
in state
C
.
(d) The lowercase letter “l.”
Italicize the lowercase letter “
l
” when used as a subdivision, as in a statute or rule, to distinguish it from the numeral “1”:
§ 23 (
l
)
cmt.
l
(e) Mathematical expressions.
Italicize mathematical formulas and variables that can be produced using standard word processors:
E = mc
2
a > 2b
Do not italicize mathematical expressions, formulas, equations, and variables that require using specialized typological programming languages like LaTeX or MATLAB.
