Citation Sentences and Clauses
(pp. 3–4)
In non-academic legal documents, such as briefs and opinions, citations generally appear within the text of the document immediately following the propositions they support. Footnotes should only be used in non-academic legal documents when permitted or required by local court rules.
A citation may be inserted into the text of a document in one of two ways: as a stand-alone citation sentence or as a citation clause.
Citation sentences
begin with a capital letter and end with a period. One citation sentence may contain multiple citations separated by semicolons. Use citation sentences to cite sources and authorities that relate to the
entire
preceding sentence:
The U.S. Supreme Court has the power to invalidate statutes that are repugnant to the U.S. Constitution.
Marbury v. Madison
, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177–79 (1803) (federal laws);
Fletcher v. Peck
, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 87, 139 (1810) (state laws);
Dred Scott v. Sandford
, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 395 (1856),
superseded by constitutional amendment
, U.S. Const. amend. XIII. The U.S. Supreme Court also has the power to review state court decisions.
Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee
, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304, 377–78 (1816) (civil cases);
Cohens v. Virginia
, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 350 (1821) (criminal cases).
Citation clauses
are set off from the text by commas and immediately follow the proposition to which they relate. Do not begin a citation clause with a capital letter unless the citation clause begins with a source that would otherwise be capitalized. Do not end a citation clause with a period, unless it is the last clause in the sentence. Use citation clauses to cite sources and authorities that relate to only
part
of a sentence:
The Supreme Court adopted a broad reading of the Commerce Clause during the New Deal,
see
Wickard v. Filburn
, 317 U.S. 111, 128–29 (1942), though in recent years the Supreme Court has somewhat reined in its broad reading,
see
United States v. Lopez
, 514 U.S. 549, 624 (1995);
United States v. Morrison
, 529 U.S. 598, 612–13 (2000);
Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius
, 567 U.S. 519, 552 (2012).
But see
Gonzales v. Raich
, 545 U.S. 1, 39 (2005).
