Introductory Signals
(pp. 4–5)
A
signal
is a shorthand message to the reader about the relationship between a
proposition
and the source or authority cited for that proposition. Refer to
rule 1.2
for more information on how to use these signals.
Bluepages Tip:
Signals are capitalized when used to begin a citation sentence but are lowercase when used to begin a citation clause.

Use
[no signal]
The authority directly states the proposition, is the source of a quotation, or was mentioned in the proposition
E.g.
,
The authority is one of multiple authorities directly stating the same proposition
Accord
The authority is one of multiple authorities directly stating or supporting the proposition, and one of the other authorities was mentioned in the proposition
See
The authority supports, but does not directly state, the proposition
See also
The authority provides additional material supporting the proposition
Cf.
The proposition supported by the authority is different from the main proposition but sufficiently analogous to lend support
Compare
. . . [
and
] . . .
with
. . . [
and
] . . .
The authorities are similar in important respects
Contrast
. . . [
and
] . . .
with
. . . [
and
] . . .
The authorities are different in important respects
Contra
The authority directly states a proposition contrary to the main proposition
But see
The authority clearly supports a proposition contrary to the main proposition
But cf.
The authority supports a proposition analogous to the contrary of the main proposition
See generally
The authority is helpful background material related to the proposition
Bluepages Tip:
You may combine
“
e.g.
,”
with
“
see
”
or
“
but see
”
to form
“
see, e.g.
,”
or
“
but see, e.g.
,”
respectively. Both “
see, e.g.
,” and “
but see, e.g.
,” should be completely underlined (other than the last comma for each).
When using more than one type of signal in a citation sentence, the signals (together with the authorities they introduce) should appear in the order in which they appear in the table above. For more information about the grouping and ordering of signals, see
rule 1.3
.
Separate authorities within each signal with semicolons. If certain authorities are considerably more helpful or authoritative than the other authorities, you may list the more helpful authorities first.
For further guidance on the order of authorities, see
rule 1.4
.
