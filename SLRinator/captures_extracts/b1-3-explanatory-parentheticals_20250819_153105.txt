Explanatory Parentheticals
(pp. 5–6)
Regardless of the type of authority you cite, it may be helpful to include additional information to explain the relevance of the cited authority. Append this information parenthetically at the end of your citation (but before any subsequent history).
Explanatory parentheticals should begin with a present participle, unless the parenthetical contains a quoted sentence or a short statement. You may omit extraneous words, such as “the,” unless doing so would cause confusion. Do not begin with a capital letter or end with a period
unless
the parenthetical consists of a quotation that reads as a full sentence:
See
Flanagan v. United States
, 465 U.S. 259, 264 (1984) (explaining that the final judgment rule reduces potential for parties to “clog the courts” with time-consuming appeals).
Atl. Richfield Co. v. Fed. Energy Admin.
, 429 F. Supp. 1052, 1061–62 (N.D. Cal. 1976) (“Not every person aggrieved by administrative action is necessarily entitled to the protections of due process.”).
5 U.S.C. § 553(b) (2000) (requiring agencies to publish notice of proposed rulemaking in the
Federal Register
).
Such standards have been adopted to address a variety of environmental problems.
See, e.g.
, H.B. Jacobini,
The New International Sanitary Regulations
, 46 Am. J. Int’l L. 727, 727–28 (1952) (health-related water quality); Robert L. Meyer,
Travaux Preparatoires for the UNESCO World Heritage Convention
, 2 Earth L.J. 45, 45–81 (1976) (conservation of protected areas).
