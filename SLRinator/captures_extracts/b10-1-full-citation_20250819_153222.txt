procedural phrase
. Abbreviate “in the matter of,” “petition of,” and similar procedural phrases to “

Omit “The” as the first word of a party’s name, unless it is part of the name of the object of an in rem action. You may abbreviate any words with eight letters or more if substantial space is saved and the result is unambiguous. You may also abbreviate entities with widely recognized initials, such as NAACP and FCC:

Bluepages Tip:
Underline the entire case name up to but not including the comma that follows the case name.
(vi) When referring to the full name of a case in a textual sentence, as opposed to a citation sentence or clause, underline the case name and only abbreviate widely known acronyms and the following eight words: “

,” (“
association
”), “
Bros.
,” (“
brothers

,” (“
corporation
”), “
Inc.
,” (“
incorporated
”), “
Ltd.
,” (“
limited
”), and “
No.
” (“

”). The first time you mention a case in the text, follow the case name with the remaining elements of a full citation, set off by commas:

Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York
, 366 N.E.2d 1271 (N.Y. 1977), the court applied a version of the diminution in value rule.
Not:

Penn Central
.
Not:
The Supreme Court’s recent takings jurisprudence has gradually moved away from the New York Court of Appeals’s formulation in
City of New York
.
B10.1.2 –
Reporters and Pinpoint Citations
Cite a
reporter
by listing: (1) the volume number of the reporter in which the case is published; (2) the abbreviated name of the reporter (listed in
table T1
); and (3) the page on which the case report begins. If word limits are a consideration,
Bluepages B6
optionally permits reporter abbreviations in court documents to be closed.
To point your reader to the specific pages that relate to the cited proposition, you must also include a
pinpoint citation
, often called a “
pincite
.” Place pincites after the page on which the case report begins, separated by a comma.
A pincite may consist of a
page range
, in which instance you should indicate the first and last page of the range separated by an en dash or hyphen. Where the page numbers consist of three or more digits, drop any repetitious digits other than the final two digits (e.g.,
102–06; 1020–30
). To cite
multiple pages that are not consecutive
, list each page or page range, separated by commas (e.g.,
103, 106–08, 132
). If the material you wish to reference appears on more nonconsecutive pages than is convenient to list in one citation, you may use
passim
in lieu of a pincite. To cite a footnote, give the page on which the footnote appears, “
n.
,” and the footnote number, with no space between “
n.
” and the footnote number (e.g.,
199 n.4
):
Baker v. Carr
, 369 U.S. 186, 195 (1962).
Newdow v. U.S. Cong.
, 328 F.3d 466, 471 n.3 (9th Cir. 2003).
Garfias-Rodriguez v. Holder
, 702 F.3d 504, 514 (9th Cir. 2012) (“This is a permissible reading of the statute.”).
Bluepages Tip:
If the pincite is the first page of the case, simply repeat the page number:
United States v. Baxter
, 492 F.2d 150, 150 (9th Cir. 1973).
For further guidance on pincites, see
rule 3.2
.
B10.1.3 –
Court and Year of Decision
Indicate parenthetically the deciding court followed by the year of decision (immediately following the page reference). When citing decisions of the United States Supreme Court, however, do not include the name of the deciding court.
Table T1
lists the correct abbreviations for courts in U.S. jurisdictions.
(i) The United States Supreme Court: Cite
United States Reports
(
U.S.
) if the opinion appears therein; otherwise, cite to
Supreme Court Reporter
(
S. Ct.
):
Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson
, 477 U.S. 57, 60 (1986).
Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv.
, 139 S. Ct. 361, 365 (2018).
(ii) Federal Courts of Appeals: Cite
Federal Reporter
(
F.
,
F.2d
,
F.3d, F.4th
) and indicate the name of the court parenthetically:
Env't Def. Fund v. EPA
, 465 F.2d 528, 533 (D.C. Cir. 1972).
United States v. Jardine
, 364 F.3d 1200, 1203 (10th Cir. 2004).
(iii) Federal District Courts: Cite
Federal Supplement
(
F. Supp.
,
F. Supp. 2d, F. Supp. 3d
) and indicate the name of the court parenthetically:
W. St. Grp. L.L.C. v. Epro
, 563 F. Supp. 2d 84, 91 (D. Mass. 2008).
Harris v. Roderick
, 933 F. Supp. 977, 985 (D. Idaho 1996).
Bluepages Tip:
The correct abbreviation for each state is listed in
table T10.1
. Some state names are abbreviated with two capital letters (e.g.,
N.Y.
), while others are abbreviated with one capital letter and several lowercase letters (e.g.,
Mich.
). Do not include a space between adjacent single capital letters (e.g.,
S.D.N.Y.
), but
do
include a space between a single capital letter and a longer abbreviation (e.g., “
D. Conn.
” for “District of Connecticut” and “
S.D. Cal.
” for “Southern District of California”). For more guidance on abbreviations, see
rule 6.1
.
(iv) State High Courts: Cite the regional reporter for the region in which the court sits, if the opinion appears therein; otherwise, cite the state’s official reporter, as listed in
table T1.3
. Indicate the state parenthetically, unless it is unambiguously conveyed by the reporter title:
People v. Armour
, 590 N.W.2d 61 (Mich. 1999).
Campbell v. Gen. Motors Corp.
, 649 P.2d 224 (Cal. 1982).
Bates v. Tappan
, 99 Mass. 376 (1868).
(v) Other State Courts: Cite the regional reporter for the region in which the court sits, if the opinion appears therein; otherwise, cite the state’s official reporter, as listed in
table T1.3
. Indicate parenthetically the state and court of decision, unless unambiguously conveyed by the reporter title. Do not indicate the department or district of intermediate state courts:
Lundman v. McKown
, 530 N.W.2d 807 (Minn. Ct. App. 1995).
Rusk v. State
, 406 A.2d 624 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1979),
rev’d
, 424 A.2d 720 (Md. 1981).
Campbell v. Parker-Hannifin Corp.
, 82 Cal. Rptr. 2d 202 (Ct. App. 1999).
Parallel Citation in State Court Documents
In documents submitted to state courts, all case citations should be to the reporters required by
local rules
. To find local rules for the court to which you are submitting a document, refer to
Bluepages table BT2
.
Local rules sometimes require citation of both the official state reporter
and
the unofficial regional or state reporter. This is called
parallel citation
. Where a pincite is necessary, include one for each reporter citation. When the state or court is clear from the official reporter title, omit it from the date parenthetical:
Pledger v. Halvorson
, 324 Ark. 302, 921 S.W.2d 576 (1996).
Kenford Co. v. County of Erie
, 73 N.Y.2d 312, 537 N.E.2d 176, 540 N.Y.S.2d 1 (1989).
B10.1.4 –
Pending and Unreported Cases
(i) LexisNexis and Westlaw cases: Cite to the LexisNexis or Westlaw electronic report of the case when one is available.
The proper format is as follows: (1) case name; (2) case docket number; (3) database identifier and electronic report number; (4) star page number; and (5) court and full date parenthetical:
Albrecht v. Stranczek
, No. 87 C 9535, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5088, at *1, *3 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 15, 1991).

, No. 1:23-cv-00270-MR-WCM, 2024 LX 18483, at *1 (W.D.N.C. May 14, 2024).
Kvaas Constr. Co. v. United States
, No. 90-266C, 1991 WL 47632, at *2–3 (Cl. Ct. Apr. 8, 1991).
Bluepages Tip:
Different courts and publishers use different formats for case docket numbers (e.g.,
CIV-A
,
Civ. A.
,
Civ.
,
No.
).  Cite the case docket number exactly as it appears. If more than one docket number is assigned to a case, the lead-in language (e.g.,
CIV-A
,
Civ. A.
,
Civ.
,
No.
) may be omitted after the first reference:
PKFinans Int’l Corp. v. IBJ Schroder Leasing Corp.
, Nos. 93 Civ. 5375, 96 Civ. 1816 (SAS) (HBP), 1996 WL 525862 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 1996).
(ii) Slip opinions:  When a case is unreported, but is separately available as a slip opinion, give the docket number, the court, and the full date of the most recent major disposition of the case:
Groucho Marx Prods. v. Playboy Enters.
, No. 77 Civ. 1782 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 1977).
For further guidance on slip opinions, see
rule 10.8.1(b)
.
(iii) Opinions  only available online, but not in an electronic database: Some cases, particularly ones that are pending, can only be accessed through a court’s website. In this situation, the webpage URL may be included:
Kaye v. Trump
, No. 5128, slip op. at 1 (N.Y. App. Div. Jan. 29, 2009),
http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2009/2009_00452.htm
.
B10.1.5 –
Weight of Authority and Explanatory Parentheticals
To add information indicating the weight of the cited authority to a citation, insert an additional parenthetical following the date parenthetical. Indicate when you are citing a concurring or dissenting opinion:
Bush v. Gore
, 531 U.S. 98, 144 (2000) (5-4 decision) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (“The political implications of this case for the country are momentous.”).
Zuni Pub. Sch. Dist. v. Dep’t of Educ.
, 550 U.S. 81, 113 (2007) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“The sheer applesauce of this statutory interpretation should be obvious.”).
Webb v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.
, 57 F.3d 1067 (4th Cir. 1995) (unpublished table decision).
Wersba v. Seiler
, 393 F.2d 937 (3d Cir. 1968) (per curiam).
An
explanatory parenthetical
may also be added to briefly explain the proposition for which the case stands:
Green v. Georgia
, 442 U.S. 95, 97 (1979) (per curiam) (holding that exclusion of relevant evidence at a sentencing hearing constitutes denial of due process).
For further guidance on explanatory parentheticals, see
Bluepages B1.3
and
rule 1.5
.
B10.1.6 –
Prior or Subsequent History
A full citation should include the
prior
or
subsequent history
of the case, subject to several exceptions discussed in
rule 10.7
. Use one of the abbreviated explanatory phrases listed in
table T8
to introduce the prior or subsequent history. Include commonly used explanatory phrases such as “
aff’d
,” “
aff’g
,” “
cert. denied
,
” (subject to a two-year limitation per
rule 10.7
), “
cert. granted
,” “
rev’d
,” and “
rev’d on other grounds
,
” for every applicable citation. Underscore or italicize the explanatory phrase:
Gucci Am., Inc. v. Gold Ctr. Jewelry
, 997 F. Supp. 399 (S.D.N.Y. 1998),
rev’d
, 158 F.3d 631 (2d Cir.).
Cooper v. Dupnik
, 924 F.2d 1520, 1530–31 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that police officers’ actions did not rise to level of due process violation),
rev’d en banc
, 963 F.2d 1220 (9th Cir. 1992).
Cent. Ill. Pub. Serv. Co. v. Westervelt
, 342 N.E.2d 463 (Ill. App. Ct. 1976),
aff’d
, 367 N.E.2d 661 (Ill. 1977).
Bluepages Tip:
Explanatory parenthetical information about a case should immediately precede information about subsequent case history.
When the case has a different name in the subsequent history, provide the new case name, preceded by the phrase “
sub nom.
,
” (“under the name of”). There is no need to provide the new case name if the parties’ names are merely reversed or if the subsequent history is simply a denial of certiorari or rehearing:
Great W. United Corp. v. Kidwell
, 577 F.2d 1256 (5th Cir. 1978),
rev’d sub nom.
,
Leroy v. Great W. United Corp.
, 443 U.S. 173 (1979).
