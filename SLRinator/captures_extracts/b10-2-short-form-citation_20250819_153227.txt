Short Form Citation
(pp. 17–18)
Once you have provided a full citation to an authority, you may use a “short form” in later citations of the same authority, so long as (1) it is clear to the reader which authority is referenced; (2) the full citation falls in the same general discussion; and (3) the reader will have little trouble locating the full citation. There are several acceptable short forms for case citations. All of these forms include “
at
” followed, if necessary, by a pincite.
The following are all acceptable short form citations of page 100 of
Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co.
, 162 N.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928)
:
Palsgraf
, 162 N.E. at 100.
162 N.E. at 100.
Id.
at 100.
When using only one party name in a short form citation, use the name of the first party, unless that party is a geographical unit, a governmental entity, or another type of common litigant. You may also shorten a long party name, for example from
First Nat’l Trust & Inv. Corp.
to
First Nat’l
, so long as the reference remains unambiguous.
Short citations take a slightly different form for cases with parallel citations.
Chalfin v. Specter
, 426 Pa. 464, 465, 233 A.2d 562, 563 (1967)
, becomes one of the following:
Chalfin
, 426 Pa. at 465, 233 A.2d at 563.
426 Pa. at 465, 233 A.2d at 563.
Id.
“
Id.
” is the short form used to refer to the immediately preceding authority.
Bluepages Tip:
The “
i
” in “
id.
” is only capitalized when it begins a citation sentence. The underline always runs under the period.
(i) When used alone, “
id.
” refers to the identical pincite referenced in the immediately preceding citation:
The Supreme Court has stated unequivocally that “apprehension by the use of deadly force is a seizure subject to the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment.”
Tennessee v. Garner
, 471 U.S. 1, 7 (1985). By contrast, minimal police interference will not always constitute a “seizure” for Fourth Amendment purposes.
Id.
(ii) To refer to a different page or footnote within the immediately preceding authority, add “
at
” and the new pincite:
To determine whether a particular exercise of non-lethal police force was reasonable, courts engage in a balancing process that weighs the nature of the intrusion against the “governmental interests.”
Id.
at 8.
(iii) “
Id.
” may only be used when the preceding citation cites only
one
source:
This process weighs the nature of the exertion of force against the governmental interests at stake.
See
Heath
, 854 F.2d at 9. This is an “objective reasonableness” test.
Id.
In the example above, it is clear that “
id.
” refers to
Heath
. By contrast, the use of “
id.
” in the following example is improper because it is not clear to which authority “
id.
” refers:
Not:
To determine whether a particular exercise of non-lethal police force was reasonable, courts engage in a balancing process.
Tennessee v. Garner
, 471 U.S. 1, 8 (1985);
see also
Heath v. Henning
, 854 F.2d 6, 8 (2d Cir. 1988). This process weighs the nature of the exertion of force against the governmental interests at stake.
See
id.
at 9.
Bluepages Tip:
Sources identified in explanatory parentheticals, explanatory phrases, and prior or subsequent history are ignored for the purposes of this rule.
(iv) The “
id.
” form for cases requiring parallel citations is as follows:
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court grappled with a similarly complicated issue in an election dispute in 1967.
See
Chalfin v. Specter
, 426 Pa. 464, 477, 233 A.2d 562, 568 (1967). In
Chalfin
, the court was forced to reach a decision under a severely rushed schedule.
See
id.
at 468, 233 A.2d at 564.
(v) “
Id.
” can be used for various types of authorities—not only for cases. For further guidance on the use of “
id.
,” see
rule 4.1
.
