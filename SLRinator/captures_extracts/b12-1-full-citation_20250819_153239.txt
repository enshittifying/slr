Full Citation
(pp. 19–21)
B12.1.1 –
Federal Statutes
A full citation of a federal statute includes two elements: the official name of the act and the published source in which the act can be found. It may also include a parenthetical indicating either (i) the year the source was published or (ii) the year the statute was passed (used for session laws):
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601–9675.
Department of Transportation Act, Pub. L. No. 89-670, § 9, 80 Stat. 931, 944–47 (1966).
Bluepages Tip:
Nothing is underlined in a statute citation. “Section” is indicated by the “
§
” symbol, the plural of which is “
§§
.” For further guidance concerning citation of individual sections and subsections, see
rule 3.3
.
Codes and Session Laws
For statutes, cite a current official or unofficial
code
, an official or privately published collection of
session laws
, or a
secondary source
.
Rule 12
provides a full explanation of these sources and how to decide which one to include in your citation.
If available, cite the current official code for statutes currently in force. The official code for federal statutes is the
United States Code
, which is abbreviated “
U.S.C.
”
A citation of an official or unofficial code will tell the reader where a statute can be found by listing: (1) the title number; (2) the abbreviated name of the code; (3) the section numbers in which the act is codified; and (4) the year of the cited code edition (not the year the act was passed). The year of the cited code edition may be omitted when citing the official or unofficial United States Code, but not when citing other collections of law. Citations of an unofficial code, such as an “annotated code,” must also include the name of the publisher in a parenthetical, alongside the date, if included:
1 U.S.C. § 1.
15 U.S.C.A. § 205 (West).
To cite an individual provision of a statute, include the original section number
of the provision you wish to cite following the statute name. Note that the
“original section number” refers to a particular section of the act, not to the
section of the code in which that provision has been codified. Thus, in the first
example below, “
§ 6
” refers to section 6 of the Administrative Procedure Act,
while “
§ 555
” refers to section 555 of Title V of the United States Code:
Administrative Procedure Act § 6, 5 U.S.C. § 555.
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 § 102, 42 U.S.C. § 4332.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 § 103, 17 U.S.C.A. § 1201 (West).
Cite the
session laws
if the official or unofficial code is unavailable or insufficient, for example, when the statute does not yet appear in a code or when you need to refer to the historical fact of the statute’s enactment.
The official compilation of federal session laws is the
Statutes at Large
, abbreviated as “
Stat.
” A citation of the
Statutes at Large
includes the following elements: (1) the official or popular name of the statute; (2) the public law number, abbreviated “
Pub. L. No.
”; (3) the section number, if any; (4) the volume number, followed by “
Stat.
” and the number of the first page of the act; and (5) the year the statute was passed. Session law citations may also pincite the particular provision of the act cited and  the particular page of the session laws on which that provision appears:
Department of Transportation Act, Pub. L. No. 89-670, § 9, 80 Stat. 931, 944–47 (1966).
Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-408, 106 Stat. 1992.
Bluepages Tip:
Omit the year parenthetical if the name of the statute includes its year of enactment.
For guidance on how to indicate a statute’s prior or subsequent history, see
rule 12.7
.
B12.1.2 –
State Statutes
For state statutes, cite an official code if available.
Table T1.3
lists the official and unofficial statutory compilations of each state, with the preferred official code listed first. Although the citation form for individual state codes varies, a full citation of most state codes includes the following elements: (1) the abbreviated name of the code, as listed in
table T1.3
; (2) the cited section number(s); and (3) the year of the cited code edition (not the year the act was passed). Citations of an unofficial state code must also include the name of the publisher in the date parenthetical:
Wash. Rev. Code § 28B.20.020 (2014).
Cal. Penal Code § 181 (West 2011).
N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law § 717 (McKinney 2000).

B12.1.4 –
Federal Tax Materials
Citation of federal tax materials is governed by special rules discussed in
rule 12.9.1
and
table T1.2
. In court documents and legal memoranda discussing only the current version of federal tax laws, you may omit the year and publisher parenthetical from citations of the Internal Revenue Code (
I.R.C.
) and Treasury regulations.
Internal Revenue Code
In citations of the Internal Revenue Code, you may replace “
26 U.S.C.
” with “
I.R.C.
”:
26 U.S.C. § 61.
becomes:
I.R.C. § 61.
Treasury Regulations
Treas. Reg. § 1.72-16(a) (1963).
Treas. Reg. § 1.72-16(a), Q&A (3)(a) (1963).

When citing Treasury determinations in court documents and legal memoranda, you may use the abbreviations contained in the introductory pages of the
Cumulative Bulletin
. Thus, you may cite General Counsel Memoranda as “
G.C.M
.
” When citing Private Letter Rulings, you may use the abbreviation “
P.L.R.
” and omit the dashes from the ruling number:
Rev. Rul. 83-137, 1983-2 C.B. 41.
I.R.S. P.L.R. 8601012 (Sept. 30, 1985).
