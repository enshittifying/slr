B16.1.1 –
Consecutively Paginated Journals
Most law journals are paginated consecutively throughout an entire volume (i.e., an individual issue within a volume does not begin at page “1,” but rather picks up where the previous issue left off). To cite material appearing in a consecutively paginated periodical, follow this format:
<author(s)>, <
title of work
>, <volume number> <abbreviated periodical name> <first page of article>, <pincite>
(
<year of publication>
).
