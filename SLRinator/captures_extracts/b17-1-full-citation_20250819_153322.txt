B17.1
Full Citation
(pp. 25–27)
A full citation of a court document includes the following elements: (1) the name of the document, abbreviated where appropriate; (2) the pinpoint citation; and (3) the date of the document, if required. The citation should also include any electronic docket number, if applicable.
B17.1.1 –
Abbreviation
Abbreviate the titles of court documents according to
Bluepages table BT1
. Where there is an official record, such as the Record on Appeal in appellate litigation, always abbreviate “Record” to “
R.
” Do not abbreviate, however, when doing so will confuse the reader:
Petitioner admits filing suit more than one year after knowledge of the facts underlying its claim, Pet’r’s Br. 6, and further admits the applicability of a one-year statute of limitations, Pet’r’s Br. 7.
In Defendant’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendant asserts that the dangerous conditions giving rise to the accident resulted from someone else’s negligence, Def.’s Mem. Supp. Summ. J. 6, 9, implying that Defendant was, indeed, aware of the risk. Yet, in his Affidavit filed in support of the Motion, Defendant explicitly states that he had no knowledge of the rising water level. Def.’s Aff. ¶¶ 5–7;
see also
Jones Aff. Ex. A, at 2.
Bluepages Tip:
You may enclose citations of court documents in parentheses:
(Def.’s Resp. to Pl.’s Interrog. No. 3.)
B17.1.2 –
Pinpoint Citations
Provide a precise reference to the cited document, such as to the page and line on which the material appears in a deposition or trial transcript. Use commas only to avoid confusion. Separate page and line references by a colon. Page references should not be preceded by “
p.
,” but other subdivisions should be identified. You are generally not required to precede pincites with “
at
,” though it is customary to use “
at
” in references to certain sources such as appellate records (e.g.,
R. at 5
):
Hawkins Aff. 6.
Trial Tr. vol. 2, 31.
Pet’r’s Br. 6.
Clark Dep. 15:21–16:4.
Pls.’ Am. Answer to Def.’s Countercl. 3–4.
Travis Decl. Ex. B, at 3.
R. at 9.
B17.1.3 –
Date
Provide the date of the cited document when: (1) more than one document has the same title; (2) the date is relevant to the discussion; or (3) the date is needed to avoid confusion:
Plaintiff alleged that Defendant was driving at a rate far in excess of the posted speed limit. Compl. ¶ 7. However, her sworn testimony is to the effect that she never saw the Defendant before the accident and was thus unable to gauge his speed. Perryman Dep. 34:15–18, Aug. 7, 2002; Trial Tr. vol. 2, 51–52, Dec. 12, 2002.
Mr. Svensson attests that Plaintiff’s president cared not about the age of the inventory but only about its marketability. Svensson Aff. ¶ 5. In addition, Ms. Beatrice swears that Plaintiff’s president had the authority to waive the condition concerning the age of the inventory, Beatrice Aff. ¶ 9, May 10, 2003, and that no other corporate official had such authority, Beatrice Aff. ¶ 2, June 2, 2003.
B17.1.4 –
Electronic Dockets
Court documents filed with the electronic case management system employed by PACER for federal cases and the comparable state systems for state cases are assigned document numbers. Add this electronic docket number to the citations of electronically filed documents:
Feder Dep. 5:30–12:10, Dkt. No. 6.
Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 2, Dkt. No. 15.
Bluepages Tip:
Documents filed on PACER are imprinted with an ECF header. If these page numbers are different from the page numbers of the filed document, use the page numbers of the original document.
