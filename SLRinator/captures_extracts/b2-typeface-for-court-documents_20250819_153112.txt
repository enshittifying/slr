Typeface for Court Documents
(p.6)
Court documents and legal memoranda use two typefaces: ordinary type and
italics
(or
underscoring
).
While the Bluepages use underscoring rather than italics, keep in mind that underscoring is the equivalent of italics. For citations appearing in non-academic legal documents, follow these general rules:
Italicize (or underscore) the following information in a citation clause:
Case names, including procedural phrases introducing case names;
Titles of books and articles;
Titles of some legislative materials;
Introductory signals;
Explanatory phrases introducing subsequent case history;
Cross references, such as
id.
and
supra
; and
Words and phrases introducing related authority, such as “
quoted in
.”
Italicize (or underscore) the following information in the text of a legal document:
Titles of publications, such as
The New York Times
;
Words italicized in the original source of a quotation; and
Any other word that would otherwise be italicized, such as an uncommon foreign word.
Key differences between academic citations (the Whitepages) and non-academic citations (the Bluepages):
