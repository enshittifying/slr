Subdivisions
(p.7)
Give page numbers before date parentheticals, without any introductory abbreviations such as “
p.”
or “
at.”
Cite nonconsecutive pages by giving the individual page numbers separated by commas (e.g., “
101, 103”
).
To cite a footnote or endnote, give the page on which the note appears, “
n.
” and the footnote number:
United States v. Carolene Prods. Co.
, 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938).
When the volumes are numbered, cite the volume number in Arabic numerals. If the author of the entire work is cited, the volume number precedes the author’s name:
3 Ronald E. Mallen, Jeffrey M. Smith & Allison D. Rhodes,
Legal Malpractice
101–02 (2014).
If an authority is organized by section (
§
) or paragraph (
¶
), you may cite to these subdivisions.
Most subdivisions (such as columns or sections) in citations are abbreviated. See
table T16
for a list of subdivision abbreviations.
