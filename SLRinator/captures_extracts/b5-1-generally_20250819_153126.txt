CONTENT:
B5.1
Generally
(p.8)
Enclose all quotations, except block quotations, with quotation marks. Place commas or periods inside the quotation marks, but place all other punctuation outside the quotation marks unless such punctuation is part of the quoted text:
“When, as here, the plaintiff is a public figure, he cannot recover unless he proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant published the defamatory statement with actual malice, i.e., with ‘knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.’”
Masson v. New Yorker Mag., Inc.
, 501 U.S. 496, 510 (1991) (quoting
N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan
, 376 U.S. 254, 279–80 (1964)).
“We refused to permit recovery for choice of language which, though perhaps reflecting a misconception, represented ‘the sort of inaccuracy that is commonplace in the forum of robust debate to which the
New York Times
rule applies.’”
Masson v. New Yorker Mag., Inc.
, 501 U.S. 496, 519 (1991) (citation omitted).
