CONTENT:
B5.2
Block Quotations
(pp. 8–9)
Quotations of
fifty
or more words should be single spaced, indented on both sides, justified, and without quotation marks. This is known as a
block quotation
. Quotation marks
within
a block quotation should appear as they do in the quoted material. The citation following a block quotation should not be indented but should begin at the left margin on the line following the quotation:
[T]his presumptive privilege must be considered in light of our historic commitment to the rule of law. This is nowhere more profoundly manifest than in our view that “the twofold aim [of criminal justice] is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.” We have elected to employ an adversary system of criminal justice in which the parties contest all issues before a court of law. . . . To ensure that justice is done, it is imperative to the function of courts that compulsory process be available for the production of evidence needed either by the prosecution or by the defense.
United States v. Nixon
, 418 U.S. 683, 708–09 (1974) (citation omitted). The Court then balanced this interest against the evils of forced disclosure.
