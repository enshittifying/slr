B5.3
Modifying Quotations and Citations for Clarity
(p.9)
When a quotation includes material quoted from another source, the quotation may, for clarity, be stripped of internal quotation marks, brackets, ellipses, internal citations, and footnote reference numbers; the original sources of quotations within the quotation need not be cited parenthetically; and capitalization may be changed without brackets. Indicate these changes parenthetically with “
(citation modified).
” Other than the changes specified, the text of the quotation after modification should match the text used in the source cited. If the quotation is altered further, indicate the changes or omissions according to
rules 5.2
and
5.3
.
Thus:
“[A]n ‘on the merits’ adjudication is” understood as “one that actually ‘pass[es] directly on the substance of [a particular] claim’ before the court.”
Semtek Int’l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.
, 531 U.S. 497, 501–02 (2001) (alteration in original) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 19 cmt. a (A.L.I. 1982)).
becomes:
“An on the merits adjudication is” understood as “one that actually passes directly on the substance of a particular claim before the court.”
Semtek Int’l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.
, 531 U.S. 497, 501–02 (2001) (citation modified).
The modification of any quotation under
Bluepages B5.3
affirmatively represents that any alterations were made solely to enhance readability and that the quotation otherwise faithfully reproduces the quoted text.
Bluepages Tip:
The parenthetical “
(citation modified)
” should be used in lieu of any other parenthetical that indicates a quotation or citation has been modified for readability, such as “
(cleaned up),
” especially when such parentheticals lack a definite meaning in practice.
