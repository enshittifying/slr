Abbreviations, Numerals, and Symbols
(pp. 9–10)
The Bluebook
contains tables with lists of specific abbreviations for arbitral reporters (
T5
), case names, institutional author names, and common words in periodical titles (
T6
), court names (
T7
), explanatory phrases (
T8
), legislative documents (
T9
), geographical terms (
T10
), judges and officials (
T11
), months (
T12
), institutional names in periodical titles (
T13
), publishing terms (
T14
), services (
T15
), and subdivisions (
T16
).
Close up adjacent single capitals (
U.S.
), but do not close up single capitals with longer abbreviations (
S. Ct.
). Every abbreviation should be followed by a period (
Univ.
), except those in which the last letter is set off by an apostrophe (
Soc'y
).
Because many court systems impose word limits on briefs and other documents submitted to the court, abbreviations in reporter names may optionally be closed to conserve space, even if they would normally be separated under this rule. For example, “S. Ct.” would become “
S.Ct.
” and “F. Supp. 2d” would become “
F.Supp.2d
.
”
Spell out the numbers zero to ninety-nine. Use numerals for larger numbers (unless they begin a sentence).
