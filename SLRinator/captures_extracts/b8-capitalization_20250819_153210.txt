Capitalization
(pp. 10–11)
In addition to capitalizing “
Court
” when naming any court in full or when referring to the U.S. Supreme Court, also capitalize “
Court
” in documents when referring to the court that will receive your documents.
While court documents can be abbreviated in accordance with
Bluepages B17.1.1
and
Bluepages table BT1
in citations, do not abbreviate the titles of court documents in textual sentences:
This Court has already ruled on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.
But:
The court in
Watkins
was attempting to distinguish earlier precedent pointing in the other direction.
Capitalize party designations such as “
Plaintiff
,” “
Defendant
,” “
Appellant
,” and “
Appellee
” only when referring to parties in the matter that is the subject of your document:
Plaintiff denies Defendant’s baseless allegations of misconduct.
But:
In
Smith
, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant acted in bad faith.
Capitalize the title of a court document only when: (1) the document has been filed in the matter that is the subject of your document; and (2) the reference is to the document’s actual title or a shortened form thereof. Do not capitalize references to the generic name of a court document:
In their Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants are strictly liable for Plaintiffs' injuries.
The Court’s Order of May 7, 2004, directed Plaintiffs to cease production immediately.
But:
There is no doubt that the initial temporary restraining order was within the bounds of this Court’s discretion.
Bluepages Tip:
Do not abbreviate the titles of court documents in textual sentences:
For all of the above reasons, Appellant’s Petition for Rehearing ought to be granted.
Not:
For all of the above reasons, Appellant’s Pet. Reh’g ought to be granted.
