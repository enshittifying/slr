Introduction
(p.3)
The Bluepages provide a uniform system of citation for legal practitioners. Please keep the following in mind:
Local Rules.
Many courts have their own rules of citation that differ in some respects from
The Bluebook
. Make sure to abide by any citation requirements of the court to which you are submitting your documents. An index of jurisdiction-specific citation rules is contained in
Bluepages table BT2
.
Typeface.
The Bluepages keep the tradition of
underscoring
certain text. So long as you are consistent, however, you may substitute
italics
wherever
underscoring
is used in the Bluepages. The remainder of
The Bluebook
employs a more complex array of typeface conventions, including ordinary roman type,
italics
, and
Small Capitals
. These differences are explained in
Bluepages B2
.
The Whitepages.
Where the Bluepages and local court rules are silent regarding the citation of a particular document, you may use the other rules in
The Bluebook
, referred to as the “Whitepages,” to supplement the Bluepages. Keep in mind the typeface differences between academic documents and non-academic legal documents as explained in
Bluepages B2
.
The Elements of a Citation.
Generally, a legal citation is composed of three elements: (1) a signal; (2) the source or authority; and (3) parenthetical information. The Bluepages explore each of these elements in detail.
Special Note for Law Students
:
The Bluebook
is primarily written for two types of users: academics and practitioners. The Whitepages provide rules for academic publications such as law review articles and research papers. The Bluepages set forth permissible deviations from the Whitepages that are designed to accommodate the needs of lawyers and law clerks. The Bluepages are used primarily for briefs, motions, memoranda, and opinions. For the most part, the Bluepages only provide examples of how a citation should look. For comprehensive discussions of the elements of a citation, you should refer to the corresponding Whitepages as cross-referenced in the Bluepages.
Bluepages Tip:
The Bluepages parallel the Whitepages in numbering and content. You may use a Whitepage rule to supplement a corresponding Bluepage rule.
