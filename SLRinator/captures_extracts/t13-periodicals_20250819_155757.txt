Institutional Names in Periodical Titles
(pp. 346–48)
Always use the title of the periodical that appears on the title page of the issue you are citing, even if the title of the periodical has changed over time.
Note that preferred abbreviation conventions for individual journals may differ from those listed in this table. The abbreviation conventions listed here are primarily intended to serve a national audience and to clearly indicate the cited source.
To abbreviate English language periodical titles, use
tables T13
,
T6
, and
T10
. Common institutional names (e.g., law schools, professional organizations, and geographic units commonly found in institutional names) are listed in
table T13
. If an institutional name is not listed in
table T13
, individual words should be abbreviated using
tables T6
and
T10
. If a word in an institutional name is not listed in these tables, use the full word in the abbreviated periodical title.
Abbreviate “University” as “
U.
” (“
U. Chi. L. Rev.
”) Omit the words “a,” “at,” “in,” “of,” and “the” (but retain the word “on”). Also, if the title consists of only one word after the words “a,” “at,” “in,” “of,” and “the” have been omitted, do not abbreviate the remaining word.
Rule 6.1(a)
explains the spacing of abbreviations:
Maggie Blackhawk,
The
Supreme Court, 2022 Term — Foreword: The Constitution of American Colonialism

Harv. L. Rev.

If a periodical title itself contains an abbreviation, use that abbreviation in the abbreviated title:
IMF
Surv
.
Not:
Int‘l Monetary Fund Surv.
Omit commas from periodical title abbreviations but retain other punctuation:

For periodical titles containing colons, omit words following the colon from the abbreviation:

Not:
