T2.19
Iran, Islamic Republic of
(Civil/Islamic Law)
Cases
Iran has a three-tiered court system, but since the 1979 Revolution, lower-court cases have not been reported, and the only Supreme Court cases reported have been unification cases (cases taken to resolve split decisions by different branches of the Supreme Court or by lower courts). Such cases from 1944 to 2002 are contained in a one-volume reporter issued by the Law Research Directorate of the President's Office in 2003. It organizes cases chronologically by subject. The title of this volume is as follows:
Majmū‘ah-i ārā’-i Vahd. at-i Ravīyah-i Dīvān-i ‘ālī-i Kishvar [Compilation of the Unification Decisions of the Supreme Court].

Historically, following the dissolution of the Islamic religious courts, introduction of the European legal system, and formation of what was then called
‘Adlīyah-i Jadīd
(New Justice) in Iran in 1927, it was not the practice to report court decisions. In 1954, the decisions of the then-eight chambers of the Supreme Court, as well as the decisions made at the general meetings (the court sitting en banc) of the Supreme Court from 1932 to 1954, were published. This serial collection continued its publication annually, with a change of publisher and format in 1964, until the 1979 Revolution.
Majmū‘ah-i Ravīyah-i Qaz. ā’ī [Compilation of Jurisprudence].
Court of Administrative Justice
: Article 173 of the 1979 Constitution established the Court of Administrative Justice in order to investigate complaints and grievances concerning civil servants, organs, or state agencies and regulations. Currently, the Court has ten chambers. The Official Gazette of the Islamic Republic of Iran regularly publishes the decisions of the Court. The Court also provides a database of all its authoritative decisions.
