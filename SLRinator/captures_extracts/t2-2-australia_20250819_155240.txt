Australia
(Common Law)
Cases
Reported decisions
Citation format:
<case name, in italics>
(
<year of publication, when different from volume number>
)
<volume number> <reporter abbreviation> <first page>
,
<page(s) of specific material, if desired>
(
<country abbreviation if not evident from context>
).
Or:
<case name, in italics>
[
<year of volume, if it constitutes volume number>
]
<part number, if applicable> <reporter abbreviation> <first page>
,
<page(s) of specific material, if desired>
(
<country abbreviation if not evident from context>
).
Only the name of the first plaintiff and first defendant should be cited. Where there are multiple proceedings between the same parties, the number of the decision, if included in the case name itself, should be indicated in square brackets. For example:
Mabo v Queensland [No. 2]
(1992) 175 CLR 1, 5 (Austl.).
Note that all case names are in italics, and the abbreviation “
v
” for “
versus
” is not followed by a period. Case names may be abbreviated according to
tables T6
and
T10
but should also not include periods. For example:
GA v Dep’t of Educ & Training
[2004] NSWADT 2 (Austl.).
Where the Commonwealth of Australia is a party, retain only “
Commonwealth
” as the party name. Where a state or territory is a party, omit “State of” or “Territory of” and retain only the state or territory name as the party name (for example, “
Queensland
” rather than “State of Queensland”). Where an Attorney-General is a party, cite as “
A-G
.” Where the Department of Public Prosecutions is a party, cite as “
DPP
.” Both “
A-G
” and “
DPP
” should be followed by the relevant jurisdiction short abbreviation in parentheses. For example:
Silbert v DPP (WA)
[2004] HCA 9 (Austl.).
Jurisdiction short abbreviations are as follows:
Commonwealth
(
Cth
),
New South Wales
(
NSW
),
Victoria
(
Vic
),
South Australia
(
SA
),
Western Australia
(
WA
),
Tasmania
(
Tas
),
Queensland
(
Qld
),
Northern Territory
(
NT
), and
Australian Capital Territory
(
ACT
). The Crown is abbreviated as “
R
” except as a respondent, when it is cited as either “
The Queen
” or “
The King
.” For example:
Dickson v The Queen
(2010) 241 CLR 491 (Austl.).
In some reporters, the year acts as the volume number, so there is no separate volume number and parentheses should not be placed around the year. When the year is the volume number, the year is cited in square brackets. The volume year should be cited even when it differs from the year of the decision. When more than one part is issued per volume, the part number is cited after the volume number. For example:
Perini Corp v Commonwealth
[1969] 2 NSWLR 530 (Austl.).
In some instances, a reporter uses paragraph references or other indicia rather than page numbers. In such instances, cite to the subdivision reference used by the reporter. For example:
Hart v Herron
[1984] Aust Torts Report ¶¶ 80-201 (Austl.).
The best available report of a case should be cited. When available, an official reporter should be cited. A generalist reporter is preferred to a subject-specific reporter. When including more than one citation, cite the official reporter first. The correct abbreviation for a reporter will be included in the front of the reporters. Official reporters include the
Commonwealth Law Reports
(
CLR
), the
Federal Court Reports
(
FCR
), the
Victorian Reports
(
VR
), and the
New South Wales Law Reports
(
NSWLR
).
If relevant, the court may be cited in parentheses subsequent to a citation. For example:
Aldrick v EM Invs (Qld) Pty Ltd
[2000] 2 Qd R 346 (Court of Appeal) (Austl.).
Courts
High Court of Australia
(the final court of appeal with both original and appellate jurisdiction since 1901): Cite to
CLR
, if therein. An avenue of appeal to the
Privy Council
(
PC
) was previously permitted, but limited in 1968 and abolished in 1975. All appeals from state and territory courts to the PC were abolished in the 1980s. For Privy Council decisions, cite to a reporter listed under
table T2.43 United Kingdom
, if therein; otherwise, cite to an official Australian reporter.
Federal Court of Australia
(established in 1976, sits in each state and in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, with original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction from single judges of the Federal Court, decisions (other than family law decisions) of the Federal Circuit Court, and some decisions of State and Territory Supreme Courts): Cite to
FCR
, if therein.
Family Court of Australia
(established in 1975, with original and appellate jurisdiction regarding family and child support disputes (other than in Western Australia); hears mainly complex cases and appeals): Cite to
Fam LR
, if therein.
Federal Circuit Court of Australia
(formerly the
Federal Magistrates Court
, which was established in 2000) (established in 2013, sits in each state capital and other major regional centers and is the only federal court that regularly conducts regional circuits; provides an accessible alternative to litigation in the Federal Court of Australia and Family Court of Australia, with which it broadly shares jurisdiction): Cite to
FCR
, if therein.
There are several authorized federal law reports in Australia, and a number of additional subject-specific reports that may also be used. Some law school websites list various law reports and their abbreviations, including:
The University of Melbourne,

. Citation may be made directly to the Australian Constitution. For example:

).
(Statutes of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory were referred to as ordinances prior to self-government.)
The short title of an act is found within the text of the act. When an act does not have a short title, the long title should be used. For example:

Where multiple abbreviations and numbers are needed, no comma should be used between them (e.g., pt III div 2).
Acts cited are presumed to be as amended. Amending acts do not need to be cited unless the amending statute is being directly cited. Reference to the year should be to the year the act was originally passed, not the year of amendment.

Internet sources
There are several free internet sources for primary legal materials.
ComLaw is managed by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and is intended to provide low- or no-cost access to the law. ComLaw includes Commonwealth primary legislation (and ancillary documents) and the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments (FRLI) (established in January 2005 under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003). ComLaw also contains all Commonwealth Gazette Notices published since July 1, 2013; copies of General and Special Notices published between October 1, 2012 and June 30, 2013; and PDF versions of Gazettes published between July 1, 2002 and December 31, 2012. Gazettes are no longer printed.
The PDF versions of all legislative instruments and many Acts on ComLaw are authoritative. Authoritative text is stamped with the document’s unique identifier on every page and relevant records are marked with one of two variations of a “tick” logo. This logo displays a map of Australia in blue overlaid with a red check mark. ComLaw is accessible at
http://www.comlaw.gov.au
.
AustLII, the Australasian Legal Information Institute, is a joint facility of the University of Technology Sydney and the University of New South Wales. AustLII contains primary and secondary materials, including Commonwealth and state and territory legislation and case law. AustLII is not an authoritative source. It does not always contain the most up-to-date legislation, although it usually contains the most recent cases as well as oral argument transcripts from the High Court of Australia. AustLII is available at
http://www.austlii.edu.au
