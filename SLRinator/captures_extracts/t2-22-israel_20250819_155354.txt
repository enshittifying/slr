Israel’s highest court functions both as the country’s Supreme
Court of
Appeals
, hearing appeals from lower courts, and as the
High Court of Justice
(HCJ), hearing constitutional and certain administrative petitions. Cite to
Piske
Din

usually in certain administrative, civil, and criminal matters. Some district
courts also serve as special courts, e.g., DC TA and DC Hi also serve as DC
for Economic Affairs, and DC Jer also serves as the Competition Law Court.

Religious Courts
