Courts
Lebanon has different categories of courts, including religious courts dealing mainly with family law matters. The most commonly cited courts are as follows:
Ma h
.
kamat al-Tamyīz
(Tamyīz) (Court of Cassation: highest court of
ordinary jurisdiction). This court sits only in the capital and has several
chambers referred to generally by numbers (Chamber 1, Chamber 2, and so
forth). Citation is sufficiently recognized by referring to this court only as
“Tamyīz” or “Qarār (decision) Tamyīz.”
Mah. kamat al-Isti’nāf
(Isti’nāf) (courts of appeals: general courts of second instance). Lebanon is divided into a number of appellate jurisdictions. Citation is sufficiently recognized by referring to this court as “Isti’nāf” or “Qarār Isti’nāf,” followed by the name of its geographic jurisdiction.
Mah. kamat al-Darajat al-Ūlā
(Courts of First Instance). This court is composed of two sections, the section of the “Qād. ī Munfarid” ( Judge of First Instance), and the section of the “Ghurfat Mah. kamat al-Darajat al-Ūlā” (Chamber of First Instance). Lebanon is divided into a large number of first instance jurisdictions. Decisions of first instance are seldom published or cited. Citations are sufficiently recognized by referring to the section (judge or chamber of first instance) or to the “h. ukm” (judgment) of such sections followed by the name of its geographic jurisdiction.
