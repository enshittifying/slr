(Common Law)
Cases
Medium-neutral citations
In 2005, the Supreme Court of New Zealand adopted a medium-neutral citation format. The Court of Appeal adopted this format in 2007, and some other courts followed later. A large number of tribunals have also adopted neutral citation formats since 2010. If a medium-neutral citation has been assigned by the court it should be used to cite the case. If the case has also been reported, cite the medium-neutral citation followed by the citation to the report, separated by a comma. Do not give the court identifier at the end of the decision, as this is evident from the neutral citation.
Citation format:
<case name>
[
<year>
]
<medium-neutral court abbreviation> <case reference number>
at
<paragraph number in brackets or page number, if desired>
per
<judge identifier, if applicable>
(
<country abbreviation if not evident from context>
).
If a decision contains paragraph numbers, use these for pinpoint references. If there are no paragraph numbers, use the report page number instead. For example:
Aylwin v. Police
[2008] NZSC 113, [2009] 2 NZLR 1 at [8] (N.Z.).
The medium-neutral court abbreviations for those that have adopted this format, and the years of adoption, are as follows:
Supreme Court
NZSC
2005
Court of Appeal
NZCA
2007
High Court
NZHC
2012
Employment Court
NZEmpC
2010
Environment Court
NZEnvC
2010
Family Court
NZFC
2012
Note that the Privy Council also adopted medium-neutral citations in 2001, with the abbreviation
UKPC
.
Reported decisions
If a case is reported in more than one report, cite only to the most authoritative report. The New Zealand Law Reports is currently the only official report (see below). Citation format:
<case name>
<year of decision in parentheses or brackets>
<volume number>
<reporter abbreviation>
<first page>
(
<court abbreviation>
) at
<page(s) or [paragraph(s)] of specific material, if desired>
per
<judge identifier, if applicable>
(
<country abbreviation if not evident from context>
).
Year of decision:
1)
If the reports are in a consecutively numbered series from the first volume, use parentheses around the year, which references the year of the decision.
R v. Noble
(2006) 22 CRNZ 422 (HC) at 422.
2)
If the report series consists of one or more volumes per year with no consecutive number sequence, use square brackets.
In some reports, the year acts as the volume number and therefore there is no separate volume number. In such cases, square brackets are used instead of parentheses around the year. Particular attention should be paid to reports that have changed titles (see below).
Kerridge v. Kerridge
[2008] NZFLR 30 (HC).
Kain v. Hutton
[2008] NZSC 61, [2008] 3 NZLR 589 at [47] per Tipping J.
Attorney-General v. Zaoui
[2005] NZSC 38, [2006] 1 NZLR 289.
3)
All pre-1900 reports use parentheses and the year reference is to the year of the decision.
Wellington Gas Co v. Patten
(1881) NZLR 3 CA 205.
The correct citation form with abbreviation is indicated in the front of the reports.
Where the court of decision is not obvious from the title of the report, the name of the court (abbreviated) should be included at the end of the citation. Common abbreviations are
High Court
(HC),
Court of Appeal
(CA),
Supreme Court
(SC), and
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
(PC).
