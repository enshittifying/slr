Constitution
Since 1947, when Pakistan was created, the country has adopted three constitutions: one in 1956, another in 1962, and the last one, which is still effective, in 1973. The latest constitution took effect on August 14, 1973. Since its adoption, it has undergone a number of amendments. In citing the constitution and its amendments, the following forms may be used:
Pakistan Const.
art. 4, § 2, cl. a.
Pakistan Const
. art. 63(1)(h),
substituted by
The Legal Framework Order, 2002, C.E.’s Order No. 24 of 2002 (Pak.).
Statutes
Government publications are preferred sources. The Pakistan Code (
Pak. Code
), an official publication of the compilation of all laws of Pakistan, is the primary source of citation. The Code, however, is not regularly updated to reflect enactments amending the statutes. Otherwise, citation to a commercial law publisher is appropriate. The most commonly cited commercial law publications for statutes are
All-Pakistan Legal Decisions
,
National Law Reporter
,
Key Law Reports
, and
Pakistan Law Journal
. These reporters publish statutes, regulations, and decisions of the superior courts of Pakistan.
The Political Parties Act, No. 5 of 1962,
Pak. Code
(2d ed. 1967), v. 14,
amended by
The Political Parties (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 1985, 1985 PLD (Statutes) 18 (Pak.).
Other codes may be cited as follows:
Pakistan Code
Pak. Code
Code of Civil Procedure
Pak. Code Civ. Proc.
Code of Criminal Procedure
Pak. Code Crim. Proc.
Pakistan Penal Code
Pak. Penal Code
Provincial-level legislation can be found in provincial codes such as the Punjab Code, the Sindh Code, and the Baluchistan Code. However, they do not appear to be frequently updated. Each province also has its own official gazette, which publishes bills and acts.  Bills and acts at the provincial level can also be found on provincial government or assembly websites, such as Punjab Laws Online (
http://www.punjablaws.gov.pk/index.html
).
Session laws
Session laws of Pakistan, including amendments of former acts, are published in the official gazettes of Pakistan. The gazettes are difficult to obtain, however, and receipt is often delayed. Furthermore, the government printer does not bind the looseleaf form gazettes individually or annually. Private commercial law publishers print them in bound volumes annually, and session laws may be cited to such commercial publications as those listed previously. The official gazettes should be cited as sources for the most recent laws if a commercial publication has not yet reported them.

The National Vocational and Technical Education Commission Ordinance, No. 5 of 2008,
The Gazette of Pakistan Extraordinary
, May 31, 2008.
Regulations
Statutory Rules and Orders (
S.R. & O.
) is the primary official source for regulations issued under Central Acts and should be preferred to other sources. For rules after 1970, commercial publications should be cited as:
<regulation name>
(
<year>
),
<volume number>
<reporter abbreviation>
<first page>
,
<page(s) of specific material, if desired>
(
<country abbreviation if not evident from context>
).

The Pakistan Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Rules (1985), 38 PLD (Statutes) 37 (Pak.).
