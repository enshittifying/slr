Romanization
For romanization of Korean sources, use the Revised Romanization of Korean (국어의 로마자 표기법; Gugeoui Romaja Pyogibeop), the official romanization system released by the Korean government in 2000 and amended in 2014, available at
https://www.korean.go.kr/front_eng/roman/roman_01.do
provided by the National Institute of Korean Language. However, if '헌' is used in the context of the Constitution, transliterate to ‘hun’ instead of ‘heon’ as both the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court use the former on their websites.
