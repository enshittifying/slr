T2.41
Sri Lanka
(Mixed System)
English is the primary language of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. Decisions of these courts are published in English. Trial courts include the  Magistrates’ Court, Small Claims Court, District Court and High Court; these operate in the official language of the region (Sinhala or Tamil). Some proceedings and decisions of these courts are in English, but are not routinely or formally reported. Laws and regulations are translated into English, with many statutes indicating that the Sinhala version is authoritative in case of an inconsistency with the Tamil text.
Cases
The primary law reporter since 1978 is the Sri Lanka Law Reports, abbreviated “
Sri L.R.
