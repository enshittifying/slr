1921–date
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the collective name of four countries: England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.The four separate countries were united under a single parliament in London, known as the United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster, through a series of Acts of Union. The United Kingdom has recently undergone a period of devolution with the creation of a Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, and Northern Ireland Assembly that may pass legislation in certain areas. As such, it is necessary to establish whether an Act of Parliament applies to the entire United Kingdom; to England; to England and Wales; to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland; or to Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland); and refer to the countries appropriately. This information can be found at the end of Acts of Parliament in the section entitled “extent.” Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories do not form part of the United Kingdom, although the final court of appeal in certain of these jurisdictions remains the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

Neutral citation
All judgments after 2001 have a neutral citation, a format independent of the publishing source that allows for immediate online publishing.
Citation format:
<case name>
[
<year of publication>
]
<neutral citation abbreviation> <neutral citation court abbreviation, if necessary> <case reference number>
, [
<paragraph(s) of specific material, if desired>
] (appeal taken from

) (
<jurisdiction abbreviation if not evident from context>
).
Archbold v. Royal Coll. of Veterinary Surgeons [2004] UKPC 1, [2]–[3] (appeal taken from Eng.).
Cases that are also reported in the official
Law Reports
should first list the neutral citation and then the citation of the official reporter:
<case name>
<neutral citation>
,
<citation to official reporter>
(
<jurisdiction abbreviation if not evident from context>

Supreme Court

See
table T2.43.1 England and Wales
for a list of more neutral citation abbreviations, along with appropriate court abbreviations.
Parentheses and square brackets
For England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the year should be in parentheses in citations when the reporter can be found without reference to the year. If the year is an integral part of the citation and necessary to locate the correct volume of the reporter, it should be in square brackets. An easy way to determine whether square brackets or parentheses are needed is to look at the citation. If you need the year to locate the case, it should be in square brackets. However, if you do not need the year to identify the case because the citation includes references to a volume number, the year should be in parentheses rather than square brackets. Compare the two examples below:
Donoghue v. Stevenson [1932] AC 562 (HL) (appeal taken from Scot.).
R v. Lockwood (1782) 99 Eng. Rep. 379 (KB).
Scotland only uses square brackets for neutral citations.
Case name peculiarities
In shipping cases, the name of the ship is commonly used instead of the first
case name. The case
Golden Strait Corp. v. Nippon Yusen Kubishka Kaisha
is
therefore also known as
The Golden Victory
(the name of the ship).
Golden Strait Corp. v. Nippon Yusen Kubishka Kaisha [2007] UKHL 12,
[2007] 2 AC 353.
The Golden Victory [2007] UKHL 12, [2007] 2 AC 353.
In criminal law, it is common for references to the Crown to be removed from the case name.
R v. Brown
can be referred to with its full name, or as
Brown
.
R v. Brown [1993] UKHL 19, [1994] 1 AC 212.
Brown [1993] UKHL 19, [1994] 1 AC 212.

Cases
Prior to 1865
Prior to 1865, there was no official series of law reports. Cases were reported in numerous commercial reporters, commonly referred to as the nominate reporters. Subsequently, most of the nominate reporters were reprinted in a series referred to as the
English Reports
(
Eng. Rep.
). The
English Reports
should be cited if the case is available therein, and a parallel citation to the original nominate reporter should also be given. Providing the name of the court that heard these cases is not required, but maybe included if desired.
