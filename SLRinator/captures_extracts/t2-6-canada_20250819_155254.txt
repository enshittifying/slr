5)
Neutral citations.
Since 1998, many Canadian courts and administrative tribunals have adopted neutral citations. The neutral citation is applied to the case prior to dissemination and thus cannot be changed. A neutral citation is denoted by two main characteristics: the year of decision without brackets or parentheses, and the court abbreviation, not separated by periods. Neutral citations are preferred over other citations. A neutral citation should always be placed before a parallel case citation.
Citation format:
<case name>
,
<year of decision> <neutral citation court abbreviation> <document number>
,
<parallel citation, if desired>
(
<country abbreviation if not evident from context> <province abbreviation, if applicable>
).

.
6)
Case citations to electronic systems.
The two main electronic legal research systems for Canada are Westlaw Canada (
WL
) and Quicklaw (
QL
). Each system assigns its own citations to decisions that it collects.
WL
citations are normally denoted by two main characteristics: the year of decision without brackets or parentheses, and the electronic reporter name that includes the word “
Carswell
.”
QL
citations are normally denoted by three main characteristics: the year of decision in brackets, the electronic reporter abbreviation that includes the letter “
J
,” and the document number preceded by “
No.
” A neutral citation or a citation to a printed reporter is preferred.
WL citation format:
<case name>
,
<year of decision> <online reporter name> <document number>
(
<country abbreviation> <province abbreviation, if applicable> <court abbreviation, if applicable>
) (WL).
Apple Computer Inc. v. Mackintosh Computers Ltd., 1987 CarswellNat 675 (Can. F.T.C.D.) (WL).

CanLII is a free collection of Canadian cases, tribunal decisions, and law. CanLII provides its own citation system, denoted by three main characteristics: the year of decision without brackets or parentheses, CanLII as the reporter name, and the document number applied by CanLII.
CanLII citation format:

Pinpoint citations
Generally, it is appropriate to provide a pinpoint citation to a specific page in the printed reporter, especially for cases published prior to 2002. For SCC cases published after 1996, and other cases published after 2002, provide a pinpoint citation to the specific paragraph, if available. Pinciting to a paragraph is also appropriate when referring to content from an online legal research service.
Chase v. Campbell, [1962] S.C.R. 425, 426 (Can.).
