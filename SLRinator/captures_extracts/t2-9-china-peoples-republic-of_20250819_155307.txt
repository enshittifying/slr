Romanization
For romanization of Chinese language citations, follow the instructions in
rule 20.2.4
.
Translated sources

1)
Follow
rule 20.2.5
, giving parallel citations to the original language source and a translated version;
2)
Where the original is difficult or impossible to verify, cite to the
translated source without reference to the original language version.
In this case, it is not necessary to preface the source with “
translated in
.”

legislative affairs division of the National People’s Congress or the State
Council, a government agency, or a court (including government and court
