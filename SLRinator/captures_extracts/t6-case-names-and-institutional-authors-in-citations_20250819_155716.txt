Case Names and Institutional Authors in Citations
(pp. 333–36)
Abbreviate case names, institutional author names, and periodical titles in citations by abbreviating any word listed below (
rules 10.2.2
and
16
). It is permissible to abbreviate other words of eight letters or more if substantial space is thereby saved and the result is unambiguous in context. (Thus, it would be permissible to abbreviate “Encyclopaedia Britannica” to “
Encyc. Britannica
” or “Petroleum” to “
Petrol.
”) Unless otherwise indicated, plurals are formed by adding the letter “s.” Abbreviate any word in the possessive form by adding an apostrophe if the word is plural and an apostrophe with the letter “s” if the word is singular (Thus, abbreviate “Employees’” to “Emps.’” and “Employee’s” to “
Emp.’s
”).
For periodical titles only, the rules in this paragraph apply. Abbreviate “University” as “
U.
” (“
U. Chi. L. Rev
.”). Also, omit the words “a,” “at,” “in,” “of,” and “the” (but retain the word “on”). Furthermore, if the title consists of only one word after the words “a,” “at,” “in,” “of,” and “the” have been omitted, do not abbreviate the remaining word.
Rule 6.1(a)
explains the spacing of abbreviations.
When citing a medical periodical whose title contains a word not found in this table, use the National Library of Medicine (NLM) abbreviation for that word if available. Search for the journal title in the NLM Catalog (
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/journals
) to find the NLM abbreviation for the journal. Use this method only for words that do not already have a standard
Bluebook
abbreviation.
