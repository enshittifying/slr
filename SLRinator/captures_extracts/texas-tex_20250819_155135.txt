Officially published opinions of the Commission of Appeals from 1879 to 1892 were adopted by the Supreme Court and should be cited as opinions of the Supreme Court. Opinions of the Commission of Appeals from 1918 to 1945 have a notation from the Supreme Court that usually appears in the final paragraph of the opinion, e.g., “opinion adopted,” “holding approved,” or “judgment adopted.” Commission opinions that were adopted by the Supreme Court should be cited as opinions of the Supreme Court. “Holding approved” and “judgment adopted” opinions are cited by using “holding approved” or “judgm’t adopted,” e.g., Savage v. Cowen, 33 S.W.2d 433 (Tex. Comm’n App. 1930, judgm’t adopted).
