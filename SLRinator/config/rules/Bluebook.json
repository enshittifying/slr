Place the footnote call number at the end of the entire sentence, after the period.

(This is a departure from the Bluebook’s normal rule for related authorities, where sources are separated by semicolons only if they were published within twenty years.)\n<br>• <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>: Don’t include the edition number; instead, include the year that the edition was published in the parenthetical.\n<br>• <i>Federalist</i> papers: SLR’s official version is compiled in Ralph Ketcham’s <i>The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates</i> (1986). Cite that version for any references to Federalist essays (e.g., <i>THE FEDERALIST NO. 10</i>). But if an author includes a pinpoint cite, use the page number from the relevant <i>Federalist</i> essay as printed in Ketcham’s volume (even if the essay numbering is different).\n<br>• <i>Foreign Affairs Federalist</i> / <i>Pacificus-Helvidius</i> debates: SLR’s official version is compiled in JAMES MADISON & ALEXANDER HAMILTON, <i>THE PACIFICUS-HELVIDIUS DEBATES OF 1793–1794</i> (Morton J. Frisch ed., 2007).\n<br>• <i>The Federalist</i> (anti-federalist): For the anti-federalist <i>Federal Farmer</i> letters, SLR’s official version is compiled in <i>ESSAYS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</i> (Paul Leicester Ford ed., 1892). We often cite these letters as <i>Federal Farmer</i> letters, despite their name.\n<br>• <i>U.N.

For example, if a piece is in a supplement, you may need to add a “Supp.” designation. Or if a periodical is organized by season rather than month, you may need to add that (e.g., “Fall 2023”). If an issue is a special symposium issue, you may need to add that (e.g., “Symposium Issue”). Authors often leave out those designations, so you should keep an eye out for them.\n\nSee BB 16.4; BB 16.5.",
