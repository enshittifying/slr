12.8 : Codication Information for Session LawsSpecial Note: You must attach (a) screenshot(s) to the Sourcepull, R1, or R2 files of the codificationinformation using the links below for every session law in your split. Add an extra page to the PDF.SLR always includes codification information when citing statutes as session laws. See BB 12.4(f).Session laws refer to specific laws the author has elected to cite instead of a statute, e.g., the CivilRights Act. These are common and the single greatest pain point in SLR editing. To find codificationinformation, use the Office of the Law Revision Counsel (OLRC) tables here, here, and here (this link beingthe most useful).Example: Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-352, tit. VII, 78 Stat. 241, 253-66 (codified asamended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, 2000e-1 to -17). Redbook Note: This comes from OLRCTable III and can be viewed here.If only certain sections of the session law are cited, give the codification information for thosesections. If the entire session law is cited, give the codification information for the entire act.More detailed instructions for finding codification information are included at the end of thisdocument. Please consult the MEs with questions on how to use or navigate these tables. A sessionlaw is “codified as amended” if any codified provision was subsequently updated or revised.Otherwise, it is simply “codified.”THE REDBOOK—SLR VOLUME 78Back to Top42Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, Pub.

No. 116-207, § 4, 134 Stat. 1001, 1002-03(codified at 15 U.S.C. § 278g-3b).When a statute is codified in nonconsecutive ranges, use the following conventions (with theUnited States Code as an example). If the codification can be expressed in three or fewer ranges ofsections, all within a single title, include all sections.If there are more than three ranges, cite the statute as being “codified [as amended] in scatteredsections of U.S.C.” Cf. BB 12.2.2(a).If the statute is codified in two different titles, include all sections in which it is codified unlessdoing so would require more than three nonconsecutive ranges of sections, in which case youshould cite it as being “codified [as amended] in scattered sections of and U.S.C.”If the codification spans at least three titles of the Code, cite it as being “codified [as amended] inscattered sections of the U.S. Code.”Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub.
