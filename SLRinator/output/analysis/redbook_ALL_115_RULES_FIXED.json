      "text": "Contrary to BB 1.5(b), BB 1.6(a)(i), and the Rand example in footnote 5 of BB 15.10.1, SLR convention is to place explanatory parentheticals after the collection information (rather than after the \u201cin\u201d phrase introducing the collection). For example:\n\nJane Doe, Toward a Theory, in GREAT PAPERS 3, 4 (2024) (arguing that . . .).\n\nThe Bluebook suggests that the parenthetical explanation belong after \u201cJane Doe, Toward a Theory,\u201d, before the \u201cin\u201d phrase. But SLR instead places it at the end, as in the above example. If you see an \u201cin\u201d-introductory parenthetical in a citation, shift it to the end.\n\nNote: There is an exception for cases in which the explanatory parenthetical applies to the larger work (rather than to the source within the larger work). For example:\n\nJane Doe, Toward a Theory, in GREAT PAPERS 3 (John Smith ed., 2024) (collection of essays analyzing . . .).\n\nHere, the explanatory parenthetical applies to Great Papers (the larger work) as a whole, so it belongs before the \u201cin\u201d phrase. But if it applies to the smaller work (Jane Doe\u2019s essay), it belongs at the end of the cite.

Do not use \u201c2022 WL . . .\u201d if a case was decided in 2022. Instead, find an official version (see RB 11.1).

(This is a departure from the Bluebook\u2019s normal rule for related authorities, where sources are separated by semicolons only if they were published within twenty years.)\n<br>\u2022 <i>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary</i>: Don\u2019t include the edition number; instead, include the year that the edition was published in the parenthetical.\n<br>\u2022 <i>Federalist</i> papers: SLR\u2019s official version is compiled in Ralph Ketcham\u2019s <i>The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates</i> (1986). Cite that version for any references to Federalist essays (e.g., <i>THE FEDERALIST NO. 10</i>). But if an author includes a pinpoint cite, use the page number from the relevant <i>Federalist</i> essay as printed in Ketcham\u2019s volume (even if the essay numbering is different).\n<br>\u2022 <i>Foreign Affairs Federalist</i> / <i>Pacificus-Helvidius</i> debates: SLR\u2019s official version is compiled in JAMES MADISON & ALEXANDER HAMILTON, <i>THE PACIFICUS-HELVIDIUS DEBATES OF 1793\u20131794</i> (Morton J. Frisch ed., 2007).\n<br>\u2022 <i>The Federalist</i> (anti-federalist): For the anti-federalist <i>Federal Farmer</i> letters, SLR\u2019s official version is compiled in <i>ESSAYS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</i> (Paul Leicester Ford ed., 1892). We often cite these letters as <i>Federal Farmer</i> letters, despite their name.\n<br>\u2022 <i>U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)</i>: SLR\u2019s official source is the United Nations website, which contains the final official version of the convention in PDF form.\n\nIf in doubt about which version of a work to use, leave an [SE:] Comment.
