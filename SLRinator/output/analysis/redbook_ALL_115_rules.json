For example:\n\nJane Doe, Toward a Theory, in GREAT PAPERS 3, 4 (2024) (arguing that . . .).\n\nThe Bluebook suggests that the parenthetical explanation belong after \u201cJane Doe, Toward a Theory,\u201d, before the \u201cin\u201d phrase. But SLR instead places it at the end, as in the above example. If you see an \u201cin\u201d-introductory parenthetical in a citation, shift it to the end.\n\nNote: There is an exception for cases in which the explanatory parenthetical applies to the larger work (rather than to the source within the larger work). For example:\n\nJane Doe, Toward a Theory, in GREAT PAPERS 3 (John Smith ed., 2024) (collection of essays analyzing . . .).\n\nHere, the explanatory parenthetical applies to Great Papers (the larger work) as a whole, so it belongs before the \u201cin\u201d phrase. But if it applies to the smaller work (Jane Doe\u2019s essay), it belongs at the end of the cite.

If a case is available on SCOTUSblog, or from a news organization, link to that version rather than a Westlaw version (so long as the version is clearly the same document). Do not use \u201c2022 WL . . .\u201d if a case was decided in 2022. Instead, find an official version (see RB 11.1). For newly decided cases, this can be an official PDF if one is available (as in the vaccine mandate case above) or the website of a credible news outlet or law professor. Avoid SSRN, though, unless no other source is available.\n\nSimilarly, avoid \u201cslip op.\u201d or \u201cmanuscript\u201d parentheticals (see BB 10.8.1(a)) if an alternate source is available.

If a piece you are editing cites one of these works or types of sources, be sure to follow these rules.\n\n<br>\u2022 <i>American Law Reports</i>: When citing a proposition supported by multiple ALR entries, list multiple ALR entries in the same parenthetical with semicolons between them, even if published decades apart. (This is a departure from the Bluebook\u2019s normal rule for related authorities, where sources are separated by semicolons only if they were published within twenty years.)\n<br>\u2022 <i>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary</i>: Don\u2019t include the edition number; instead, include the year that the edition was published in the parenthetical.\n<br>\u2022 <i>Federalist</i> papers: SLR\u2019s official version is compiled in Ralph Ketcham\u2019s <i>The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates</i> (1986). Cite that version for any references to Federalist essays (e.g., <i>THE FEDERALIST NO. 10</i>). But if an author includes a pinpoint cite, use the page number from the relevant <i>Federalist</i> essay as printed in Ketcham\u2019s volume (even if the essay numbering is different).\n<br>\u2022 <i>Foreign Affairs Federalist</i> / <i>Pacificus-Helvidius</i> debates: SLR\u2019s official version is compiled in JAMES MADISON & ALEXANDER HAMILTON, <i>THE PACIFICUS-HELVIDIUS DEBATES OF 1793\u20131794</i> (Morton J. Frisch ed., 2007).\n<br>\u2022 <i>The Federalist</i> (anti-federalist): For the anti-federalist <i>Federal Farmer</i> letters, SLR\u2019s official version is compiled in <i>ESSAYS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</i> (Paul Leicester Ford ed., 1892). We often cite these letters as <i>Federal Farmer</i> letters, despite their name.\n<br>\u2022 <i>U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)</i>: SLR\u2019s official source is the United Nations website, which contains the final official version of the convention in PDF form.\n\nIf in doubt about which version of a work to use, leave an [SE:] Comment.
