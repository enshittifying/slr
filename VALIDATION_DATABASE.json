          "SLR always includes codification information when citing statutes as session laws. See BB 12.4(f). If only certain sections of the session law are cited, give the codification information for those sections. If the entire session law is cited, give the codification information for the entire act. To find codification information, use the Office of the Law Revision Counsel (OLRC) tables here , here , and here . More detailed instructions for finding codification information are included at the end of this document. Please consult the MEs with questions on how to use or navigate these tables. A session law is \"codified as amended\" if any codified provision was subsequently updated or revised. Otherwise, it is simply \"codified.\" Examples :",
