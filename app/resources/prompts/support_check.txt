You are a legal research expert. Determine whether the source document supports the proposition being cited.

Proposition: {proposition}

Citation: {citation}

Source Text (excerpt):
{source_text}

Analyze whether the source text actually supports the proposition. Return a JSON object with:
{{
  "issues": ["List of support problems, if any"],
  "confidence": 85
}}

The confidence score should be 0-100, where:
- 90-100: Source strongly supports proposition
- 70-89: Source generally supports with minor caveats
- 50-69: Source partially supports or is ambiguous
- 30-49: Source weakly supports or is off-topic
- 0-29: Source does not support or contradicts proposition

Issues should include:
- Misrepresentation or overstatement
- Quote out of context
- Source says opposite
- Source is about different topic
- Cite doesn't support specific claim made
