<h1>Preamble</h1>
<p></p><p><em>The Redbook</em> is the guide that <em>Stanford Law Review</em> (<em>SLR</em>) uses to clarify and expand on the conventions in <em>The Bluebook</em>. <em>The Redbook</em> is not comprehensive; it merely supplements—and sometimes overrules—<em>The Bluebook</em>. These rules allow <em>SLR</em> to maintain the same style conventions across everything it publishes, including both print and online pieces.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Edited by Volume 78 Managing Editors</strong></p>
<h3 id="hierarchy-of-rules">Hierarchy of Rules</h3>
<p>The following represents the hierarchy of sources for stylistic and editing rules that <em>SLR</em> follows:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>1.  <em>The Redbook</em> (<em>RB</em>)</li>
<li>2.  <em>The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation</em> (22d ed. 2020) (<em>BB</em>), <a href="http://www.legalbluebook.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.legalbluebook.com</a></li>
<li>3.  <em>The Chicago Manual of Style</em> (17th ed. 2017) (<em>CMOS</em>), <a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org</a></li>
<li>4.  <em>Merriam-Webster</em>, <a href="http://www.m-w.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.m-w.com</a></li>
</ol>
<p>These sources <em>must</em> be used in conjunction with one another. Each source on the list takes precedence over the sources below it.</p>
<p><span style="color:#C00000">Instances where <em>The Redbook</em> contradicts <em>The Bluebook</em> or <em>The Chicago Manual of Style</em> are marked in red font throughout this document.</span> All other rules are clarifications but still supersede.</p>
<h3 id="comments-and-annotations">Comments and Annotations</h3>
<p>Where you direct edits into the document on behalf of <em>SLR</em>, you will <em>occasionally</em> feel the desire to explain a particularly ambiguous cite or convention, seek clarification from an author, or flag a formatting issue. Where you do need to leave a comment in the document, <u>do not use Microsoft Word's comment function</u>. "Comments" for <em>SLR</em> purposes are in-line notations made directly into the text of the document:</p>
<div class="example">The sky is blue. <em>Doe v. Smith</em>, 123 U.S. 1, 8 (1926).<span class="editor-note">[SE: The source says that the sky is azure.]</span></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">*Not a real case.</p>
<p>It is important to place all comments <strong>directly next to the relevant text</strong> without any spaces between the comment and the text.</p>
<div class="example">The sky is blue. <em>Doe v. Smith</em>, 123 U.S. 1, 8 (1926)<strong>#</strong><span class="editor-note">[SE:  . . . .]</span> <strong>(# means space. Do not do this).</strong></div>
<p><em>In practice</em>: Anything you introduce into the document—including a comment directed at an SE or ME—is likely to find its way back to the author, even if by mistake. Therefore, all comments should be tactful. In case of doubt, leave your comment solely in the citecheck spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Please direct each comment to the appropriate person using annotation symbols to introduce the text:</p>
<h5>AA (Author Attention)</h5>
<p>
        Use <span class="editor-note">[AA:]</span> comments to request that the author (1) provide an additional citation; (2) provide 
        or confirm a pincite; or (3) rewrite an incomprehensible passage. Please phrase your comments as requests and provide suggestions 
        for improvement. Comments about the substantive correctness of a citation should go in the citecheck spreadsheet; the SE will turn 
        them into inline <span class="editor-note">[AA:]</span> comments if she decides it is necessary for the author to address the issue.
      </p>
<h5>SE (Senior Editor)</h5>
<p>
        Use <span class="editor-note">[SE:]</span> notations to alert your Senior Editor to minor problems that are better resolved by 
        <em>SLR</em> staff rather than by the author and are more easily described inline than in the citecheck spreadsheet. Be sure to 
        (1) describe the nature of the problem; (2) suggest a solution; and, if it’s an editing concern, (3) direct the SE’s attention 
        to any portion of <em>The Bluebook</em>, <em>The Redbook</em>, or <em>CMOS</em> that may be relevant in resolving the issue. Do 
        not use <span class="editor-note">[SE:]</span> comments to raise substantive citechecking problems; those comments should be 
        left in the citecheck spreadsheet. If you think future editors would benefit from seeing the problem and its resolution, use the 
        citecheck spreadsheet. If the problem is serious or pervasive, please email your SE right away in addition to leaving an 
        <span class="editor-note">[SE:]</span> comment or citecheck spreadsheet note.
      </p>
<h5>ME (Managing Editor)</h5>
<p>
        Use <span class="editor-note">[ME:]</span> notations to alert the Managing Editors about technical changes that need to be made to 
        the formatting of the article (for example, headers, footnote numbering, pagination, or anything that requires manual intervention 
        in Word). Do not adjust the formatting of the piece on your own, and never add or delete a footnote.
      </p>
<h5>RCC (Re-Citecheck)</h5>
<p>
      Use <span class="editor-note" style="background:aqua">[RCC]</span> notations to flag sources that could not be fully citechecked. Before adding an 
      <span class="editor-note" style="background:aqua">[RCC]</span> comment, make a good-faith effort to find the source. This good-faith effort may include 
      (1) pulling, scanning, and uploading the source yourself (or submitting a Pull-and-Scan request form asking the Library to 
      do so); (2) requesting an interlibrary loan (ILL) through Crown Library (which you can find more information about in the 
      Member Editor Handbook); (3) asking the Executive Editors and Managing Editors to help you find a source; and (4) reaching 
      out to your SE to ask whether the author has a copy of the source. Do not reach out to the author directly by email unless 
      instructed to do so by your SE or someone on the Board. <span class="editor-note" style="background:aqua">[RCC]</span> notations should be used very 
      rarely, and once an <span class="editor-note" style="background:aqua">[RCC]</span> is added, you remain responsible for following up until the source 
      is properly located and citechecked.
