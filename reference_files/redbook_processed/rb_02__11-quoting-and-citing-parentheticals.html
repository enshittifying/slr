<p><em>SLR always </em>requires a quoting parenthetical when the quoted source is itself quoting another source. If the author has forgotten to include a quoting parenthetical, you are responsible for adding one yourself, which may involve locating and pulling the quoted source, citechecking it, and uploading it to Box. However, <em>SLR </em>never <em>requires </em>a citing parenthetical. If the author wants to include a citing parenthetical, they may do so, but you need not add one or ask the author to add one. </p>
<p><em>For quoting and citing parentheticals, you are responsible for citechecking the quoted or cited source just as if the author had cited it directly. </em>Occasionally, checking the quoted source is impracticable because it is impossible to retrieve. If you add a quoting parenthetical but are unable to citecheck the quoted source, please be sure (1) to leave an <span class="editor-note" style="background:aqua">[RCC]</span> in the document and (2) to flag the issue for your SE. </p>
