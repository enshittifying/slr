<h3 class="rule-subtitle">16.6: Checking for Special Designations </h3>
<p>Per <em>BB </em>16.7, always check whether a piece appearing in a law review is a note, comment, or other student- written work; book review; or other specially designated work (that is, anything that is not an “article”). Please be sure to include this designation in the citation. <em>Example</em>: </p>
<div class="example">Jamie D. Halper, Note, <em>Friends, Classmates, Alumni, Lend Me Your Student Notes</em>, 76 <span class="small-caps">Stan. L. Rev. </span>1, 3 (2024) (noting the Note’s notable contributions to the scholarship discussing noteworthy notations). </div>
<p>Signs that a piece is a student-written work include that (1) the author’s name appears at the end, rather than the beginning, of a piece; (2) there is no author bio footnote on the first page; and/or (3) there is such a footnote, and the author is identified as a student or recent graduate. </p>
<p>If you are unsure whether the piece is an article or another type of piece, check the Table of Contents to see how it is described there and leave a comment for your SE. </p>
<p>This rule also applies to other periodicals. For newspapers (including those available online), check whether the piece is an editorial, opinion, or letter to the editor per <em>BB </em>16.6(a). <em>Example</em>: </p>
<div class="example">Elizabeth W. Tarbell, Letter to the Editor, <em>No Chico for Me</em>, <span class="small-caps">S.F. Chron. </span>(June 5, 2023), https://perma.cc/SS2H-TMFA (urging members of <em>SLR </em>to refer to Horace Preston Payne III by his full legal name). </div>
