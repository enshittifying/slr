<h3 id="3-2-capitalizing-internal-references">3.2: Capitalizing Internal References</h3>
<p>Any reference a piece makes to itself, its Parts, or its author(s) should be capitalized (and should never be described as "It"). Thus, "Part," "Subpart," "Introduction," and "Conclusion" should always be capitalized—for example, "In the next Part, I discuss <em>Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach</em>." "Article," "Essay," "Note," "Comment," and "Book Review" should also be capitalized when the author is referring to the piece being edited—for example, "In this Essay, I lay out why bees are fish"—but not to another piece. </p>
<p><em>SLR </em>capitalizes "Author" if the author refers to themself as the author of the piece being edited, but not as the author of any their previous works. This rule does not apply to an (on file with author) parenthetical. </p>
<p><em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>BB </em>17.2.1. </p>
