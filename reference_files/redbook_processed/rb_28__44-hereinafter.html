<h3 id="4-4-hereinafter">4.4: Hereinafter </h3>
<p>If you think a "hereinafter" may be warranted, do not add it yourself. Instead, leave an <span class="editor-note" style="background:yellow">[SE:]</span> comment. </p>
<p>In general, editors tend to overestimate the need for hereinafters. There are only two circumstances in which inserting a hereinafter would be appropriate. First, according to <em>BB </em>4.2(b), hereinafter should be used to differentiate between two sources by the same author that are both <em>introduced </em>in the same footnote—even if those sources are differentiated by formatting. </p>
<p>However, never introduce hereinafters that will never actually be used later. So, if only one work is cited again later in the article, only provide a hereinafter for that source. If neither source is cited again later, do not provide any hereinafters at all. </p>
<p>Finally, note that merely <em>citing </em>(as opposed to <em>introducing</em>) multiple sources by the same author in a single footnote does not call for the use of hereinafter. <em>Example</em>: </p>
<div class="example">
<ol>
<li><em>See </em>Taylor Swift, <em>Monsters Turning into Trees</em>, 43 <span class="small-caps">U. Chi. L. Rev. </span>352, 357-59, 370 &amp; n.56 (2014) [hereinafter Swift, <em>Monsters</em>] ("We were in screaming color."); <em>see also </em><span class="small-caps">Taylor Swift, King of Thieves </span>45, 47 (2010) [hereinafter <span class="small-caps">Swift, Thieves</span>] (citing <span class="small-caps">Spider-Man </span>2 (Sam Raimi dir., 2004)); <span class="small-caps">Taylor Swift, <em>You're Losing Me</em>, on Midnights (The Late Night Edition) </span>(Republic Records 2023). </li>
<li><span class="small-caps">Taylor Swift, Lover </span>(Republic Records 2019). </li>
<li><em>Compare </em><span class="small-caps">Swift, Thieves</span>, <em>supra </em>note 1, at 49 ("Karma's a relaxing thought "), <em>and </em><span class="small-caps">Swift</span>, <em>supra </em>note 2, <em>with </em>Swift, <em>Monsters</em>, <em>supra </em>note 1, at 359 n.49 (reviewing statutes of limitations to determine whether tortfeasors are "in the clear yet"). <em>But see </em><span class="small-caps">Ariana Grande, Starbucks Confusion </span>27 (2020) (reflecting on the difficulty of ordering a venti latte). </li>
<li><span class="small-caps">Grande</span>, <em>supra </em>note 3, at 35; <em>see also </em><span class="small-caps">Swift</span>, <em>supra </em>note 2. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Second, hereinafter is appropriate when a source is cited again later <em>and </em>its "short" form would otherwise be particularly unwieldy (that is, exceeding roughly one line in length). <em>Example</em>: </p>
<div class="example">
<ol>
<li>Notice of Filing of Supplemental Exhibit to Debtors' Motion for Entry of (I) An Order (A) Approving Bidding Procedures &amp; Bid Protections in Connection with the Sales of Certain of the Debtors' Assets, (B) Approving the Form &amp; Manner of Notice, (C) Scheduling Auctions &amp; a Sale Hearing, (D) Approving Procedures for the Assumption &amp; Assignment of Contracts, &amp; (E) Granting Related Relief &amp; (II) An Order (A) Approving the Sale of Assets Pursuant to the Bidding Procedures, (B) Authorizing the Sale of Assets Free &amp; Clear of Liens, Claims, Encumbrances, &amp; Interests, (C) Authorizing the Assumption &amp; Assignment of Contracts, &amp; (D) Granting Related Relief at 7, <em>In re </em>Patriot Coal Corp., No. 15-32450 (Bankr. E.D. Va. June 23, 2015), ECF No. 385 [hereinafter Patriot Notice]; <em>see also </em>1 U.S.C. § 1 (defining certain words). </li>
