<p><em><strong>Subsequent history and negative treatment</strong></em>: <em>Always </em>check for subsequent history (for example, <em>aff'd</em>, <em>cert. denied</em>, <em>rev'd</em>) and negative treatment (for example, <em>abrogated in part</em>, <em>overruled</em>, <em>superseded by statute in other part</em>). Include subsequent history and negative treatment whenever required by <em>BB </em>10.7 or particularly relevant to the purpose for which the author is citing the source. In general, this will not include negative treatment by a subordinate or "sibling" court; for example, do not list lower court opinions that "distinguish" or "decline to extend" a Supreme Court opinion, or federal circuit court opinions that critique another circuit's opinion. If in doubt, however, err on the side of inclusion. If a case's subsequent history or negative treatment seems extraordinarily complicated, email your SE and the Managing Editor assigned to the piece for further guidance.</p>
<p>Check whether Westlaw has a flag is insufficient. You must also check the "History" and "Negative Treatment" tabs. If a Westlaw flag identifies negative treatment (for example, it indicates that the case has been abrogated or overruled), read the relevant part of the subsequent case to make sure Westlaw's flag is correct. Leave a comment in the citecheck spreadsheet explaining your analysis of any negative treatment.</p>
<p><em><strong>Plurality opinions</strong></em>: Scan the beginning of opinions to determine whether any part of the principal opinion has been endorsed by less than a majority of the court. If so, be sure that any pincite to a portion of the opinion enjoying less than majority support is designated (plurality opinion). (The header in recent volumes of <em>United States Reports </em>will change from page to page depending on whether that page is endorsed by a majority of the Court, but headers in older volumes and other reporters may not.) Treat the (plurality opinion) designation as identical to a (Surname, J., concurring) or (Surname, J., dissenting) parenthetical for purposes of both full and short citations. <em>See RB </em>10.8; <em>BB </em>10.6.1(a).</p>
<p><em><strong>Solo portions of majority or plurality opinions</strong></em>: For portions of such an opinion which other members of the court do not join, which are therefore not majority or plurality opinions as to those portions, designate citations to such portions as (opinion of Surname, J.).</p>
<p><em><strong>En banc opinions</strong></em>: Examine all federal court of appeals and state appellate court opinions for an "en banc" designation. Include the (en banc) parenthetical for federal cases. For state appellate cases, leave an SE note.</p>
