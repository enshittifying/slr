<h3 class="rule-subtitle">10.10: When a Reporter Has Not Yet Been Published</h3>
<p>When a case that is to be published in a print reporter has not yet been so published, cite an electronic database, preferably Westlaw. <em>See BB </em>10.8.1. Additionally, make sure to check that the reporter has not been published since the last round of editing. If the publication is forthcoming, leave an <span class="editor-note" style="background:aqua">[RCC]</span> next to the citation. <em>Example</em>:</p>
<div class="example"><em>See </em><span class="editor-note" style="background:aqua">[RCC]</span>Sveen v. Melin, No. 16-1432, 2018 WL 2767640, at *12-15 (U.S. June 11, 2018) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).</div>
<p>The L. Ed. and U.S.L.W. reporters (for Supreme Court cases) should be used only for cases that were actually omitted from the U.S. and S. Ct. reporters. Despite the fact that the Supreme Court itself cites slip opinions for recent cases, <em>SLR </em>would almost never do so since it prefers the electronic database version to the slip opinion. <em>See RB </em>10.11.</p>
<p>Do not cite to "Preliminary Prints" of <em>United States Reports</em>; use only the finalized versions, which as of July 2023 go up through Vol. 576. Ignore all higher volumes of <em>United States Reports </em>and cite to the next-most- preferred reporter instead (which will usually be S. Ct.). Unfortunately, Preliminary Prints are visually indistinguishable from published volumes, so it is best to be generally aware of the latest "valid" volume number. The MEs will announce when a new official volume is released.</p>
