## PART 1: CORE SHORT FORM RULES (RULE 4)

### Rule 4.1: "Id." (Using the Same Authority)

**Source Location:** Rule 4.1 in Bluebook

**Full Text:**
> "Use 'Id.' to refer to the immediately preceding authority when it is the sole authority in the preceding citation and the new citation is in the same footnote or the immediately following footnote. 'Id.' always refers to the identical source, not just the same general work."

**Key Rules:**
- **When to Use:** Only when immediately preceding citation is the sole authority
- **Scope:** Same footnote OR immediately following footnote only
- **Requirement:** Must refer to identical source
- **With Pincites:** Always include "at" after id. when using a pincite
  - Example: "Id. at 100"
- **Restriction:** Do NOT use id. to refer to a source cited solely in a preceding footnote's explanatory parenthetical (use supra instead)

**Valid Examples:**
- Id.
- Id. at 100
- Id. at 116
- Id. (para. 5)
- Id. at 50

**Invalid Examples:**
- Id at 100 (missing period before "at")
- id. (lowercase when starting citation)
- Id at 100 (missing "at" before pinpoint)
- Id, at 100 (comma instead of period)

---

### Rule 4.2: "Supra" and "Hereinafter"

**Source Location:** Rule 4.2 in Bluebook

**Full Text:**
> "Use 'supra' to refer to a previously cited authority, typically for secondary sources, legislative materials, or international documents. Provide enough information in the 'supra' to avoid confusion (usually the author's last name or a short title). Use 'hereinafter' for an authority with a cumbersome name or when multiple works by the same author are cited; it follows the full citation, introduced by a comma, inside the parenthetical (e.g., ('Full Title', hereinafter 'Short Title'))."

**Key Rules for SUPRA:**
- **When to Use:** Referring to previously cited authority (not in immediately preceding footnote)
- **Typical Sources:** Secondary sources, legislative materials, international documents, books, periodicals, unpublished sources
- **Required Information:** Author's last name or short title to avoid confusion
- **Format:** Author/Title, supra note [X], [optional "at" + pinpoint]
- **Limitation:** Do NOT use for cases (use case name short form instead)

**Key Rules for HEREINAFTER:**
- **When to Use:** Sparingly, for authorities with cumbersome/long names or multiple works by same author
- **Format:** Introduced by comma inside parenthetical of full citation
- **Example Format:** ("Full Title", hereinafter "Short Title")
- **Subsequent Use:** "Short Title, supra note X"
- **Note:** Should only be used when supra would be confusing; default to supra when possible

---

### Rule 4.3: Using Id. in Footnotes (Expanded)

**Source Location:** Rule 4.3 in Bluebook (Expanded Rules)

**Full Text:**
> "Do not use id. to refer to a source cited solely in a preceding footnote's explanatory parenthetical. Use supra instead."

**Key Distinction:**
- If a source appears ONLY in a parenthetical explanation of the preceding footnote, you MUST use supra, not id.
- If the source is a primary citation (not just in parenthetical), then id. is permitted if conditions in Rule 4.1 are met

**Valid Example:**
- Footnote 5: Smith v. Jones, 100 U.S. 1 (1980).
- Footnote 6: See Smith, supra note 5 (not "id." because source was only in parenthetical of note 5)

**Invalid Example:**
- Footnote 5: Smith v. Jones, 100 U.S. 1 (1980) (discussing X).
- Footnote 6: Id. (incorrect - Smith was only cited in parenthetical of note 5)

---

### Rule 4.4: Hereinafter (Expanded)

**Source Location:** Rule 4.4 in Bluebook (Expanded Rules)

**Full Text:**
> "Use hereinafter sparingly. Unlike with supra, which should be used for all subsequent references to a source (other than with cases, statutes, etc.), hereinafter should only be used when a supra would be confusing. Hereinafter is most common for sources with very long titles and similar beginnings or multiple sources by the same author in the same year. Even if the Bluebook would allow a hereinafter, default to using supra for cases in which the potential confusion is minimal."

**Key Guidelines:**
- Use SPARINGLY - it is an exception, not a default
- Primary use case: Very long titles with similar beginnings
- Primary use case: Multiple sources by same author in same year
- Default to supra unless confusion is likely
- For cases, strongly prefer supra unless significant confusion would result

---

## PART 2: SHORT FORMS BY SOURCE TYPE

### A. CASES (Rule 10.9)

**Full Rule Text:**
> "After a full citation of a case, you can use a short form in later citations. Acceptable short forms include the case name (if unique) or a shortened case name, with or without a pinpoint cite, or 'Id.' if the immediately preceding citation is the same case. E.g., 'Roe, 410 U.S. at 116.' Do not use 'supra' or 'hereinafter' for cases."

**Valid Short Forms:**
- Case name alone: "Roe"
- Case name with reporter page: "Roe, 410 U.S. at 116"
- Shortened case name: "Roe" (from "Roe v. Wade")
- Id. (if immediately preceding citation is same case)
- Id. at [pinpoint]

**Invalid Short Forms:**
- Roe, supra note X (supra is NOT allowed for cases)
- Roe, hereinafter "R" (hereinafter is NOT allowed for cases)

**Requirements:**
- Case name must be unique OR sufficiently shortened to avoid confusion
- If not cited within previous five footnotes, must use full citation instead of short form
- Multiple cases by same parties may require additional identifying information

---

### B. BOOKS (Rule 15.10)

**Full Rule Text:**
> "Subsequent citations of books can use a short form: typically the author's last name and a pinpoint (and possibly a short title if multiple works by that author are cited). e.g., Doe, supra note 5, at 100. Or if using id.: Id. at 100 (if the immediately preceding note is the same source). Use hereinafter if the title is long and you want to shorten it in subsequent cites: provide a hereinafter in the first full citation. E.g., ... ('Short Title'). Then use Short Title, supra."

**Valid Short Forms:**
- Author only: "Doe, supra note 5"
- Author with pinpoint: "Doe, supra note 5, at 100"
- Author with short title: "Doe, Short Title, supra note 5, at 45"
- Id. (if immediately preceding is same book)
- Id. at 100 (with pinpoint)
- Short Title, supra note X (if hereinafter established)

**Invalid Short Forms:**
- Doe at 100 (missing supra reference)
- Doe, supra 5 (missing "note")
- Doe supra note 5 (missing comma)
- id. at 100 (lowercase id.)

**Hereinafter Format:**
- Full citation includes: ("Full Long Title", hereinafter "Short Title")
- Subsequent citations: "Short Title, supra note X, at [pinpoint]"

---

### C. CHAPTERS/ESSAYS IN COLLECTIONS (Rule 15.10.1)

**Full Rule Text:**
> "If you cited a chapter or essay in a collection, short form can use the chapter author's last name and 'supra note X'. If multiple chapters from the same book are cited, you may need hereinafter for the chapter title or the book title to clarify. The key is to avoid confusion between sources. E.g., Doe, supra note 12, at 45 (short form for a chapter by Doe in a multi-author book)."

**Valid Short Forms:**
- Chapter author only: "Doe, supra note 12"
- Chapter author with pinpoint: "Doe, supra note 12, at 45"
- Chapter title, supra: "Chapter Title, supra note 12, at 20"
- Id. (if immediately preceding is same chapter)

**Special Consideration:**
- Use chapter author's name (not editor's name) for short form
- If multiple chapters by same author: may need hereinafter with chapter title to avoid confusion
- If multiple chapters from same book: may need hereinafter with book title to avoid confusion

---

### D. PERIODICALS/LAW REVIEW ARTICLES (Rule 16.9)

**Full Rule Text:**
> "After a full citation, you can short cite periodicals by last name and a supra reference or id. as appropriate. E.g., Doe, supra note 4, at 460. Or just Id. if the immediately prior citation is the same article and same page series (with possibly different pinpoint). If multiple works by same author, include a short title as well to distinguish. Bluebook does not allow 'supra' for cases and certain primary sources, but for articles it's fine."

**Valid Short Forms:**
- Author only: "Doe, supra note 4"
- Author with pinpoint: "Doe, supra note 4, at 460"
- Author with short title: "Doe, Article Title, supra note 4, at 50"
- Id. (if immediately preceding is same article)
- Id. at 460 (with different pinpoint if same article)

**Special Notes:**
- Multiple works by same author MUST include short title to distinguish
- Short title drawn from full article title
- "Same page series" language suggests consistency with periodical pagination

---

### E. UNPUBLISHED SOURCES (Rule 17.6)

**Full Rule Text:**
> "Short cite unpublished sources by last name and a supra note if possible (assuming you gave a full citation in a prior footnote). E.g., Doe, supra note 10. If only one work by Doe is cited, that suffices. If a letter or interview, you might refer to it in text or use an id. if it's clear. Bluebook doesn't have special short forms beyond using supra for previously cited miscellaneous sources."

**Valid Short Forms:**
- Author only: "Doe, supra note 10"
- Author with pinpoint (if applicable): "Doe, supra note 10, at page X"
- Id. (if immediately preceding and clear)
- Document name (for letters/interviews): "Smith Letter, supra note X"

**Special Considerations:**
- Requires prior full citation with note number
- If multiple works by same author: may need short title for clarity
- For letters/interviews: may be referred to in text or by specific identifier
- No official short form beyond supra for miscellaneous sources

---

### F. INTERNET AND MEDIA SOURCES (Rule 18.9)

**Full Rule Text:**
> "Short cite internet and media sources using 'supra' with the author's name or a short title, as with other secondary sources. For example: Doe, supra note 15 (if note 15 was a web page). For cases or statutes found online, use normal short forms. If the source has an idiosyncratic title, you might use a hereinafter to simplify. For example, if a URL is the citation, in a footnote you might create a hereinafter like ('DOE BLOG'). Subsequent citations can then use DOE BLOG, supra. As always, ensure it's clear what you're referring to."

**Valid Short Forms:**
- Author/creator: "Doe, supra note 15"
- Short title from URL: "DOE BLOG, supra note 5"
- Platform name: "Law Blog, supra note 3"
- With pinpoint: "Doe, supra note 15, at para. 5"

**Special Rule:**
- For cases/statutes found online: use normal short forms (not special online rules)
- Authority name/creator is treated same as for other secondary sources

---

### G. SERVICES/LOOSELEAFS (Rule 19.2)

**Full Rule Text:**
> "Short cite services by name (if unique) and paragraph/section. E.g., CCH Cons. Fin. Guide, supra note 10, ¶ 72,205. Or simply Id. if immediately previous. Services often have continuous updates, so ensure the supra still points to the same material (services can update paragraph numbers, but assume static)."

**Valid Short Forms:**
- Service name: "CCH Cons. Fin. Guide, supra note 10"
- Service name with paragraph: "CCH Cons. Fin. Guide, supra note 10, ¶ 72,205"
- Service name with section: "Tax Service, supra note 3, § 45.02"

- Id. ¶ [X] (with different paragraph if same service)

**Special Considerations:**

- Verify paragraph numbers are current when citing
- Update information should be clear in full citation

---

### H. FOREIGN SOURCES (Rule 20.7)

**Full Rule Text:**
> "Use id., supra, etc., for foreign sources similarly. If you've given an English hereinafter, use that. E.g., German Civil Code, supra note 10, § 823. Or id. if appropriate. Ensure not to confuse foreign sources with domestic ones if similar names; clarity may require including the country in the short cite if needed (e.g., 'BGHZ, supra note 12' if used as abbreviation for German case reporter)."

**Valid Short Forms:**
- Code name: "German Civil Code, supra note 10, § 823"

---

### I. TREATIES AND INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS (Rule 21.17)

**Full Rule Text:**
> "Use supra for treaties by short name if previously cited: e.g., U.N. Charter, supra note 1, art. 55. For cases, use id. or case name short form as appropriate (e.g., Case Name, supra note 10, at para. 50). For UN docs and resolutions, you can use supra if it's clear (e.g., Resolution 1441, supra note 5). Always ensure no ambiguity. If multiple treaties or documents, a hereinafter might be used for long titles. E.g., ('UNCLOS') supra. Use id. if the immediately preceding footnote is exactly the same source and context."

**Valid Short Forms:**
- Treaty name: "U.N. Charter, supra note 1"
- Treaty name with article: "U.N. Charter, supra note 1, art. 55"
